<sentence2>I want to scrape all songs available on YouTube but I'm struggle to figure out what songs are there, can you help?</sentence2>
<sentence3>I found an open source library that generates sound programmatically by using some formulas to operate on various waveforms, i will paste some related code now and I want to ask about how they come up with these formulas, I am looking for information, references and tutorials     var generate = (duration, fn, fading = true) => {     var audioBuffer = audioCtx.createBuffer(1, sampleRate * duration, sampleRate);     var buffer = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0);     var N = audioBuffer.length;     var anim = 0;     for (var i = 0; i  Math.min(Math.max(Math.sin(i), -1), 1)   var saw = (i) => ((i % 6.28)-3.14)/6.28;   var sqr = (i) => Math.min(Math.max(Math.sin(i) * 1000, -1), 1)   var win = (i, ts, te) => {     if (ite*44100) {return 0;}     return 1 - ((i/44100) - ts)/(te - ts);   }   var note = (i, tone, time, dur) => 0.01*sqr(i / (80/Math.pow(2,tone/12))) * win(i,time,time+dur);   var hhat = (i, time) => 0.02*Math.random() * win(i,time,time+0.06);        // Transition animation -  Gate whirring open + noise of steam     gateOpenSound = generate(1, (i) => {       return 0.05 * sqr(i/250) * (sin(i/300)+0) + 0.1 * Math.random() * win(i, 0, 1);     });      // Buy an item (ding + ding)     buySound = generate(0.7, (i) => {       return 0.07 * (saw(i/19) * win(i, 0, 0.15) + saw(i/11) * win(i, 0.1, 0.7));     }); </sentence3>
<sentence4>if you are unfamiliar with the source code of webtorrent and ari2c can you look these up respectively on the web in order to build a technical issue proposal/project outline of where in the code and how to introduce an aria2c RPC client into the desktop native platforms of webtorrent to perform re-entrant roles against the aria2c service daemon </sentence4>
<sentence5>I want to create chats for multiple websites. I use rasa as my framework. How would I do that? Each have their own story (text script) Do  I need 2 different installations of rasa and models for this? Can I just change the story for each website? What do I do ? </sentence5>
<sentence6>Make me a source code for a module in Lsposed which make additional button on youtube to download videos into mp4 or mp3 forms</sentence6>
<sentence7>output audio of the following sentence;  "Do you watch YouTube videos that use text to speech? I'm curious to hear what others think on this subject and which are the best TTS systems, and why."</sentence7>
<sentence8>I need to get voice control on chat gpt , the best is extension for opera , but desktop aplication will be good to , search internet find me a way.  </sentence8>
<sentence9>tell me concisely how channels, playlists and videos relate in YouTube and compare it with some well known video streaming services out there</sentence9>


The topic is described by the following keywords: audio, aria2c, webtorrent, streamingresponse, mp4, youtube, webpilot, wav, waveforms, code,

Based on the information about the topic above, 
1) Analyze the keywords and come up with a general label. Explain why? 
2) cluster the most representative sentences to come up with sub-labels. Explain why? 

DO NOT FORGET TO include the first 10 character of that sentences that you use to come up with that sub-category, so that I can read the sentences you have clustered and see if you come up with correct label for that. 
Take your time and think, then come up with the best, precise, and meaningful label and sub-labels.

Now Take a deep breath and start
