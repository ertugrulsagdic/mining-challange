I have a topic that contains the following most representative documents:
<sentence0>I am building a phonics curriculum and am building a table to input into my database for a specific lesson plan.  The below example is for for teaching consonant blends in a phonics settings.  Can you create the same detailed tabled for "Magic E"?  Output a table that is as complete and detailed as possible.  Do not skip details.  Only include the columns below.  For the example words, try to include 5 words per row.  I want 5 example words per row to fill my database. --- | Topic        | Sub-Topic | Sample Words                                                       | | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | | L-Blends     | bl        | black, blue, blow, blend, blink, block, bluff, blunder             | | R-Blends     | br        | bread, brown, brush, break, breed, brick, brim, broom              | | L-Blends     | cl        | clock, clap, clean, cliff, clone, clash, clover, clump             | | R-Blends     | cr        | crab, crown, crisp, crack, crop, crook, crow, cradle               | | R-Blends     | dr        | drum, drive, drop, dress, drift, drag, drool, drown                | | L-Blends     | fl        | flag, flip, flow, flame, flat, flock, flash, flinch                |</sentence0>
<sentence1>postgresql versioning library by despesz vs postgresql-migrations: How do they compare?  seems like semi similar concept except versioning seems to expect you to either call each of the relevant scripts yourself or write some kind of tool to do so? And also keeps track of dependencies between migrations - this doesn't seem to do that? I guess in practice you copy the migrations sql in this project into beginning of every migration file? do you keep a separate folder that has rollbacks? (but I don't see code in this repo that deletes from the applied_migrations table)</sentence1>
<sentence2>Let's say I have a table called `responses` with a text field called `comment` that can contain strings like these:  "I got a lot of help from @4154 and @64 this week." "@4154 thanks a million!!! Also @12"  How would I do a query using Ruby on Rails to return all of the numbers that exist in the table into an array? For example `[4154, 64, 4154, 12]`</sentence2>
<sentence3>I need help naming a project. It's a thing that sets up triggers on SQLite tables to track - in a separate table - the timestamp at which every row in the main table was last inserted, updated or deleted  I thought about calling it sqlite-changes or sqlite-history but both of those imply that it tracks what values changed - it doesn't, it just tracks when the record was changed  Suggest lots of name options like that, justify them </sentence3>
<sentence4>Create a table dogs with id, species, name columns  Primary key is compound over id, species  Now create a _chronicle_dogs table with id, species, timestamp_ms integer  Create ten rows in dogs  Create ten corresponding tows in _chronicle_dogs with random ms time stamps  Delete two rows from dogs  Come up with a SQL query that returns every row in chronicle ordered by date and joins against dogs - it should add a _deleted boolean column which indicates if the tow has been deleted </sentence4>
<sentence5>I have a sqlite database. Here's the SQL for creating the table:   I want to add a column called text_content. This could be a large amount of text. Could you please update the create statement above, and also write SQL that I can run to alter an existing database?</sentence5>
<sentence6>A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan. 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use SQL to navigate through this vast network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. Take a look at the cheatsheet to learn how to do this! From there, you can use your SQL skills to find the murderer.</sentence6>
<sentence7>Create a SQLite table with a compound primary key  Write a Python function which accepts a connection and a table name. It then creates a new table called "_chronicle_{table_name}" with the same primary key columns as the original table, plus a updated_ms integer table  Then it counts the number of rows in the original table and figured out the Unix timestamp in ms minus that number   It then populates the new table with copies of the primary keys for every row in the old table, and with a updated_ms that starts at the calculated value and increases by 1 for every row  Try this against a table with a thousand rows in it  Experiment with different approaches for populating that updated_ms column, including clever things that use window functions</sentence7>
<sentence8>It turns out SQLite tables can contain rows with a null primary key. Try this:  BEGIN TRANSACTION; CREATE TABLE [nasty] (    [id] TEXT PRIMARY KEY ); INSERT INTO "nasty" VALUES(NULL); COMMIT;  I want to know how quickly a query can detect if a table contains at least on `null` primary key, as the table grows from 1 row to 100 to 1000 to 100000 to 100,000 to 1m  Benchmark that for me and plot a charte</sentence8>
<sentence9>CREATE TABLE "embeddings" (    [collection_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [collections]([id]),    [id] TEXT,    [chunk_strategy_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [strategies]([id]),    [chunk_index] INTEGER,    [embedding] BLOB,    [content] TEXT,    [content_hash] BLOB,    [metadata] TEXT,    [updated] INTEGER,    PRIMARY KEY ([collection_id], [id], [chunk_strategy_id], [chunk_index]) );  Design and run an experiment to see what the implications of having rows with a chunk_strategy_id of null would be - including trying to insert two rows with (1, "1", null, 0) to see if that null makes it possible to have two rows with the same primary key</sentence9>


The topic is described by the following keywords: sqlite, sql, rows, table, database, column, tables, createtable, row, postgresql,

Based on the information about the topic above, 
1) Analyze the keywords and come up with a general label. Explain why? 
2) cluster the most representative sentences to come up with sub-labels. Explain why? 

DO NOT FORGET TO include the first 10 character of that sentences that you use to come up with that sub-category, so that I can read the sentences you have clustered and see if you come up with correct label for that. 
Take your time and think, then come up with the best, precise, and meaningful label and sub-labels.

Now Take a deep breath and start
