My first instructing position was a summer differential equations course, for which I was the sole instructor of a one section course. I set the syllabus according to the official calendar and past courses and my own instincts, assigned the textbook and planned and delivered the lectures to over 100 students. I have also been part of teaching teams for multiple section courses, both when there is a designated senior instructor and when there is a consensus system without a senior instructor. For most courses I have taught I made course homepages and posted practice tests and practice final exams made from scratch; make enough questions and some go into the real exam some go into the practice exam.  The three courses I taught different versions of were differential equations, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus.Course instructor for undergraduate mathematics courses at the University of Toronto, at the St. George campus mostly and also several semesters at the Mississauga and Scarborough campuses.

The topic is described by the following keywords: section, fundamentals, data, development, visualizations, internal, planning, analytics, modeling, shelf,

Based on the information about the topic above, 
1) Analyze the keywords and come up with a general label. Explain why? 
2) cluster the most representative sentences to come up with sub-labels. Explain why? 

DO NOT FORGET TO include the first 10 character of that sentences that you use to come up with that sub-category, so that I can read the sentences you have clustered and see if you come up with correct label for that. 
Take your time and think, then come up with the best, precise, and meaningful label and sub-labels.
