The topic is described by the following keywords: gui, desktop, tkinter, interface, layouts, applications, software, abstractions, tools, components,

Based on the information about the topic above, 
1) Analyze the keywords and come up with a general label. Explain why? 
2) cluster the most representative sentences to come up with sub-labels. Explain why? 

DO NOT FORGET TO include the first 10 character of that sentences that you use to come up with that sub-category, so that I can read the sentences you have clustered and see if you come up with correct label for that. 
Take your time and think, then come up with the best, precise, and meaningful label and sub-labels.

Now Take a deep breath and start
