I have a topic that contains the following most representative documents:
<sentence0>i have git branch i make mistake when run git pull origin master because other team member make  git reset --hard eb03ab7090faa328380cfd82552fa67c42eac00a git push --force origin  master  now i have wrong commits how to rebase my commits after master  eb03ab7090faa328380cfd82552fa67c42eac00a?</sentence0>
<sentence1>Take a look at my repository at   I've got it working well on command line, and now I want to set up a Github Action that will run the "review" command on every commit and leave a comment on the commit. How do I do that?</sentence1>
<sentence2>Given a commit hash for Git, I want to switch to the stable-docs branch and then apply just the changes from that commit that affect files in the docs/ directory - so like a cherry-pick but just for the parts that affect docs/</sentence2>
<sentence3>this github action is adding a new contributor label and but then it removes that label from the first-time new contributor. why is this happening? if the person is opening up a pr is in fact a first-time contributor, how can i make sure it adds the new contributor label and doesn't remove it?  name: Add/Remove Labels  on:   pull_request_target:     types: [ opened ]      jobs:   add_new_contributor_label:     if: github.event.action == 'opened'     permissions:       contents: read       pull-requests: write     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: actions/github-script@v6         with:           script: |             const creator = context.payload.sender.login             const opts = github.rest.issues.listForRepo.endpoint.merge({               ...context.issue,               creator,               state: 'all'             })             const issues = await github.paginate(opts)             for (const issue of issues) {               if (issue.number === context.issue.number) {                 continue               }               if (issue.pull_request) {                 return // creator is already a contributor               }             }             await github.rest.issues.addLabels({               issue_number: context.issue.number,               owner: context.repo.owner,               repo: context.repo.repo,               labels: ['new contributor']             }) </sentence3>
<sentence4>Hello GPT, I have a function that enables to automate commit on a remote git repo.   Problem is, it's a bit slow because currently it's pure.   Every time it's called it's cloning the repo again, I think we could improve performance by throing a little cache in there you know what I mean?   I'm thinking, the repos would be cloned in node_modules/.cache/gitSSH/xxx.   We would have a directory for every repo+branch.   The would enable to just git pull wich I assume woule be faster that cloning.   Following in the code, can you help me acheive what I want?    </sentence4>
<sentence5>My website,  is a static [Hugo]( site hosted on Netlify.   The source is in a private GitHub repo, and after Netlify successfully builds and deploys the latest version, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered which builds a PDF version of the home page and stores it as a versioned GitHub release artifact.  I'd like to automatically make the latest version of that PDF available on my website by visiting the URL   The resulting PDF download should use the original versioned filename so that people are clear which version they're looking at if they download it.  Could you please suggest how I can achieve this using Netlify and GitHub?</sentence5>
<sentence6>jobs:   update_stable_docs:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - name: Checkout repository       uses: actions/checkout@v3       with:         fetch-depth: 0  # We need all commits to find docs/ changes     - name: Set up Git user       run: |         git config user.name "Automated"         git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"     - name: Check if stable branch exists       run: |         if ! git ls-remote --heads origin stable | grep stable; then           git checkout -b stable           git push -u origin stable         fi  I need this to work slightly differently: if the stable branch does not exist, it should create as new stable branch from the highest numerical tagged release in the repo - not from main</sentence6>
<sentence7>Hello, I tried to clone a repository in github without forking it in workspace using "Coder" website. Thus, I created an workspace and opened terminal, and wrote git clone --origin upstream git@github.com:(github url).git. However, I could find a error, "fatal : could not read from remote repository". How can I fix it? I am new to Git and Coder, so please explain it. </sentence7>
<sentence8>Write a GitHub Actions workflow implementing the following:  Assume a stable-docs branch exists.  Every time a new release is released the workflow updates thatbranch to exactly match the tag that was just released  Any time a commit to main includes the text "!stable-docs" all changes to docs/ in that commit should be made available in the stable-docs branch too.</sentence8>
<sentence9>I'm working on a python package that has documentation that can be compiled using `sphinx`. How can I automatically compile the documentation inside the GitHub workflow? I would like to have a documentation link in the main page of the repo that always points to the latest docs. </sentence9>


The topic is described by the following keywords: github, git, commits, repository, commit, repo, branch, ubuntulatest, stabledocs, versioned,

Based on the information about the topic above, 
1) Analyze the keywords and come up with a general label. Explain why? 
2) cluster the most representative sentences to come up with sub-labels. Explain why? 

DO NOT FORGET TO include the first 10 character of that sentences that you use to come up with that sub-category, so that I can read the sentences you have clustered and see if you come up with correct label for that. 
Take your time and think, then come up with the best, precise, and meaningful label and sub-labels.

Now Take a deep breath and start
