<sentence2>I got this command line script, can you write a pysimplegui script for it? I suggest making the LANGUAGES into dropdown, I hope you can figure out from the double while loop how it should work ... thanks. Also if you can adopt the styles a bit to make it look nice, default fonts tend to be quite small.  from googletrans import Translator, LANGUAGES   def main():     while True:         target = input("Choose a language to translate to (type 'q' to exit): ")         if target == "q":             break         if target not in LANGUAGES:             print(f'Invalid target language, valid are: {", ".join(LANGUAGES)}')             continue          while True:             text = input(                 f"Enter text to translate to {LANGUAGES[target]} (type 'q' to change language): "             )             if text == "q":                 break             translated = translate_text(text, target=target)             print(translated)   def translate_text(text, target="en"):     translator = Translator()     translation = translator.translate(text, dest=target)     return translation.text   if __name__ == "__main__":     main()</sentence2>

<sentence9>translate that into portuguese:  Hello! Thank you very much for sending these changes.  It seems to me that they are changing `README.md` instead of `README.pt.md`. The Portuguese README changes should be in `README.pt.md`.   On the other hand, we now have changes in progress with [a draft]( and [with an issue](  to clarify the versions or steps of this project. If you can change the README.pt.md I can see the changes they are proposing and see if we incorporate the issue in the pipeline or do it separately.</sentence9>
