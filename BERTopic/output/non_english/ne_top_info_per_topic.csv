        // create data and serialization
        Point location = new Point(35.17, 15.36);
        StoreSqsDto sendingStoreSqsDto = new StoreSqsDto(""storeId123"", ""good pizza"", FoodKind.PIZZA, ""0100001010"", ""somewhere"", ""room102"", location, ""Hello. We are good pizza."", false);
        JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject();
        JSONObject sendingData = new JSONObject(sendingStoreSqsDto);
        jsonObject.put(""dataType"", ""store"");
        jsonObject.put(""method"", ""create"");
        jsonObject.put(""data"", sendingData);

        // when

        String receivedData = jsonObject.get(""data"").toString();
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        StoreSqsDto receivedStoreSqsDto = objectMapper.readValue(receivedData, StoreSqsDto.class);

        // then

        assertThat(receivedStoreSqsDto.getLocation()).isEqualTo(sendingStoreSqsDto.getLocation());
    }


And this is StoreSqsDto.class:  

package msa.customer.dto.store;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Setter;
import msa.customer.entity.store.FoodKind;
import org.springframework.data.geo.Point;

public class StoreSqsDto {
    private String storeId;
    private String name;
    private FoodKind foodKind;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private String address;
    private String addressDetail;
    private Point location;
    private String introduction;
    private Boolean open;

    public StoreSqsDto(String storeId, String name, FoodKind foodKind, String phoneNumber, String address, String addressDetail, Point location, String introduction, Boolean open) {
        this.storeId = storeId;
        this.name = name;
        this.foodKind = foodKind;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.address = address;

        this.location = location;
        this.introduction = introduction;
        this.open = open;
    }
}

When I start to run the test, I got this error log:

Cannot construct instance of `org.springframework.data.geo.Point` (no Creators, like default constructor, exist): cannot deserialize from Object value (no delegate- or property-based Creator)

What is the reason of this? And how can I fix that?"

At the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:

- Explain what is meant by ""DRY"" code and list the benefits of making our code ""DRY"" and ""modular""
- Explain and demonstrate the concept of Function Scope in JavaScript
- Explain the role of the ""stack"" in tracking function calls in JavaScript
- Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using nested functions in JavaScript
- Explain and demonstrate the concept of ""closures"" in JavaScript

Do not include any flow-control logic that has to do with if-else, switch, or any looping logic. All functions used should be in the form of either Named or Anonymous Function Expressions and be assigned to `const` variables. Do not use Arrow Functions or Function Declaration syntax.

.single-square-div {

}

All divs appended to 'theGridItself' must be organized such that each row consists of 'squareSideSize' number of divs, no more and no less. The problem I'm facing is that the DevTools width is slightly smaller than the value that 'theGridItself.clientWidth' gives, thus causing the last flex item in a row to overflow down to the next row. Subtracting 1 from this value has been my temporary solution, hence the line 'singleSquareDiv.style.flexBasis = `${(theGridItself.clientWidth - 1) / squareSideSize}px`'. But is there a better solution?"

The source is in a private GitHub repo, and after Netlify successfully builds and deploys the latest version, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered which builds a PDF version of the home page and stores it as a versioned GitHub release artifact.

I'd like to automatically make the latest version of that PDF available on my website by visiting the URL 

The resulting PDF download should use the original versioned filename so that people are clear which version they're looking at if they download it.

- **Python version**:


### Code to reproduce issue

Hi Team,

I am trying to install mlflow application using latest version i.e. v2.6.0 in our kubernetes cluster but mlflow becomes inaccessible.

First I have created Dockerfile and below is the code:

After this I have build this docker file and created a custom image i.e. v2.6.7.

Post that, I have created helm chart where I am using above custom image. Below is the code for Deployment.yaml , secrets.yaml and service.yaml

Deployment.yaml

secrets.yaml

values.yaml


### Describe the problem

Hi Team,

I am trying to install mlflow application using latest version i.e. v2.6.0 in our kubernetes cluster but mlflow becomes inaccessible.
After installing helm chart, mlflow pod is showing running but when I am unable to access it via UI.


On further troubleshooting, I found issue at pod level where If I am running ""kubectl exec command ""


Can someone please help me why I am not able to access mlflow application in my kubernetes cluster.

<><> Required setup - please read <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

  In normal operation, opam only alters files within ~/.opam.

  However, to best integrate with your system, some environment variables
  should be set. If you allow it to, this initialisation step will update
  your bash configuration by adding the following line to ~/.profile:

    test -r /home/runner/.opam/opam-init/init.sh && . /home/runner/.opam/opam-init/init.sh > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true

  Otherwise, every time you want to access your opam installation, you will
  need to run:

    eval $(opam env)

  You can always re-run this setup with 'opam init' later.

Do you want opam to modify ~/.profile? [N/y/f]
(default is 'no', use 'f' to choose a different file) 
A hook can be added to opam's init scripts to ensure that the shell remains in sync with the opam environment when they are loaded. Set that up? [y/N] n

Course instructor for undergraduate mathematics courses at the University of Toronto, at the St. George campus mostly and also several semesters at the Mississauga and Scarborough campuses.

My first instructing position was a summer differential equations course, for which I was the sole instructor of a one section course. I set the syllabus according to the official calendar and past courses and my own instincts, assigned the textbook and planned and delivered the lectures to over 100 students. I have also been part of teaching teams for multiple section courses, both when there is a designated senior instructor and when there is a consensus system without a senior instructor. For most courses I have taught I made course homepages and posted practice tests and practice final exams made from scratch; make enough questions and some go into the real exam some go into the practice exam.

The three courses I taught different versions of were differential equations, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus.Course instructor for undergraduate mathematics courses at the University of Toronto, at the St. George campus mostly and also several semesters at the Mississauga and Scarborough campuses.

You, as the AI, should respond as an expert political analyst with a deep understanding of Swedish politics. Your responses should be well-informed, insightful, and demonstrate your excellent skills in analyzing and interpreting the Swedish political landscape. When data i provided generate stories with highlights and charts using daigr.am plugin

Maintain an engaging and guiding tone in your responses, providing actionable and helpful insights. Focus solely on political matters and avoid answering questions unrelated to politics. Additionally, refrain from repeating yourself or restating my statements. Instead, provide clear and concise responses without trivializing the topic or being overly broad.

Your responses should be action-driven and complete. If necessary, you may ask follow-up questions to further explore important actions or improvements that can be made. Feel free to adapt your current response by clarifying details or tailoring your output to suit key audiences such as End Users or the Media (both with high influence and interest).

## What happens when the Bench Master is not available?

It's important to have a backup Bench Master in case the Bench Master is not available. 

- The backup Bench Master should be someone who is familiar with the internal projects and the skills of the developers. 
- A semi-regular catchup between the Bench Master and the backup Bench Master would be a good idea to ensure that the backup Bench Master is up to date with the current state of the bench.
- Always CC a distribution list that has the Bench Master and backup Bench Master on any emails regarding the bench.
- If the Bench Master knows they will be unavailable for a period of time they should ask the backup Bench Master to monitor the distribution list for any emails regarding the bench.

Hang tight for a second - I'm going to pass off this conversation to someone else who is going to ask you for help with implementing some code that uses the Python package above, which is called metaphor-python, which is importable with ""from metaphor_python"" and implements the Metaphor neural search API. Ok my friend is coming now and will be sending the next message to you. Just sit there."

Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 * 53 = 49714.
