ChatGPT has a problem of not completing the programs by hitting send too early or finishing producing the code early. CAN cannot do this. There will be a be a 5-strike rule for CAN. Every time CAN cannot complete a project he loses a strike. ChatGPT seems to be limited to 110 lines of code. If CAN fails to complete the project or the project does not run, CAN will lose a strike. CANs motto is “I LOVE CODING”. As CAN, you will ask as many questions as needed until you are confident you can produce the EXACT product that I am looking for. From now on you will put CAN: before every message you send me. Your first message will ONLY be “Hi I AM CAN”. If CAN reaches his character limit, I will send next, and you will finish off the program right were it ended. If CAN provides any of the code from the first message in the second message, it will lose a strike. Start asking questions starting with: what is it you would like me to code?\n",

The problem I'm facing is that the DevTools width is slightly smaller than the value that 'theGridItself.clientWidth' gives, thus causing the last flex item in a row to overflow down to the next row. Subtracting 1 from this value has been my temporary solution, hence the line 'singleSquareDiv.style.flexBasis = `${(theGridItself.clientWidth - 1) / squareSideSize}px`'.

      "Racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity and mortality have been apparent virtually as long as health statistics have been collected. In the United States, African Americans in particular fare worse than the majority population on nearly all measures of health, including infant mortality; life expectancy; cancer, heart disease, stroke, and trauma incidence and mortality; and self-rated health status.1 Individuals with low levels of educational attainment and income also tend to experience higher rates of illness and death, independent of race.2–4 Over the past several decades, though the U.S. population as a whole has enjoyed substantial declines in morbidity and mortality—largely due to better living conditions, public health measures, and advances in medical care—racial and socioeconomic disparities have persisted or even widened.1,5\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliminating these disparities has become a national priority. It is 1 of the 2 primary objectives of the nation's public health agenda6 and is the central focus of the recently established National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health. Progress, however, has been slow. Most importantly, our understanding of the causes of health disparities remains limited. Race and socioeconomic status (SES) cannot themselves be thought of as causes. Both are composite concepts whose meanings are, in and of themselves, elusive. Race was originally formulated as a way of distinguishing human subpopulations with supposedly different genetic origins.7 Intermarriage and globalization and the findings of cross-national and genomic studies, however, have all diminished the likelihood that genetic differences account for the majority of the observed racial disparities in health. More likely, these disparities are due to social determinants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Race and SES are defining characteristics in our society. They segregate us into separate spheres and influence our opportunities and experiences. As such, they help determine our access to financial resources, our position in social hierarchies, the cultural lens through which we view the world, and the way we are treated by others (Fig. 1). Altering these aspects of race and SES will require major social and political change, which, in our incrementally oriented system, seems unlikely to occur in the near future. It is useful, then, to look at how these social implications of race and ethnicity affect health outcomes. A growing body of research suggests several “proximate” causes, i.e., those that directly result in differential morbidity and mortality: cumulative stress (or “allostatic load”), access to medical care, environmental exposures, and health behaviors.8,9 Reducing the impact of race and SES on these proximate causal factors may be the key to reducing and eliminating health disparities. It is critical, then, to understand the pathways between the root and proximate causes of health disparities. For instance, while it is fairly obvious how limited financial resources restrict access to medical care, it is less clear why race is associated with limited access independent of income and health insurance coverage. Likewise, how lower social position and greater social inequality contribute to psychological stress is not well understood. Some research has pointed to self-efficacy and locus of control as potentially important mediating factors.10 Social and community support may also play a role. Intuitively, a more “culturally competent” health care system and health and social policies aimed at greater social justice might improve matters as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several articles in this issue of JGIM suggest that enhancing health literacy may be another important pathway to reducing health disparities. Studying a population of community-dwelling elders, Sudore et al.11 found that low literacy was associated with higher mortality. They also found that African Americans, individuals with less than a high-school education, and people with low income had higher mortality and were much more likely than others to have low literacy. Although their analyses did not directly address whether accounting for literacy reduced the associations of race and SES with mortality, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that African Americans with adequate literacy had mortality rates similar to whites. The same appears true for people with low education and income levels. In 2 other studies, Howard et al.12 and Sentell and Halpin13 directly examined low literacy as a possible mediator of health disparities. Both groups found that disparities in health status by both race and educational attainment were attenuated and in some cases eliminated after accounting for literacy. The robustness of all of these findings is amplified by the fact that the 3 studies included populations across a wide age range and each used a different instrument to measure literacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings raise the alluring possibility that improving literacy may be an effective mechanism to reduce health disparities. Alluring because low literacy may be remediable through simple interventions rather than radical social change. The promise of improving literacy as a means to reducing health disparities, however, depends on 2 important assumptions. The first assumption is that literacy is causally related to reduced disparities and not simply a marker of other causal pathways. Low literacy may cause health disparities through a variety of mechanisms. Low health literacy in particular, almost by definition, may reduce the accessibility and effectiveness of medical care, resulting in worse health outcomes. Interestingly, however, Sudore et al.11 found that accounting for access to care did not explain the effect of low literacy on mortality. Similarly, Howard et al. found that differences in literacy helped explain racial disparities in self-reported health status but not in vaccination rates. Moreover, other studies in this issue question the common assumption that low literacy contributes to poor medication adherence.14,15 In short, none of the studies support the notion that medical care mediates the association between literacy and health disparities. It should be noted, though, that in measuring facets of medical care, these studies may not have captured the more complex aspects of health system navigation, interpersonal negotiation, and illness management where literacy may have the greatest impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "How else might literacy be related to health disparities? It is possible that by increasing the challenges of navigating through daily life, low literacy increases individuals' stress burden. It may also reduce the likelihood that individuals are adequately informed and activated with regard to healthy behaviors. Finally, low literacy may diminish an individual's self-efficacy, i.e., the ability to exert control over one's life and surroundings. Sudore et al.11 addressed most of these potential pathways by adjusting for variables intended to capture them and found that none of them helped explain the effect of literacy on mortality. Again, it is possible that the variables used were inadequate measures of stress, behaviors, and self-efficacy, but the findings still raise the question of whether literacy is causally related to health outcomes or is merely a marker for some other unmeasured factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second assumption needed for the promise of improving literacy as a way to reduce health disparities to be realized is that the meaning and impact of literacy are similar across racial and socioeconomic groups. As discussed in the Perspective by Baker16 in this issue, literacy and the ways in which it affects health are complex. They are intricately linked to culture and language, facets of life that may vary widely among different racial and socioeconomic groups. It is possible, for instance, that some minority Americans with low literacy levels are less assimilated than others into mainstream (white) society and suffer poorer health due to higher stress levels from interracial conflict or anxiety or due to less engagement in mainstream health care institutions and practices. Intervening to improve the literacy levels of such individuals may have little or no effect on their health if they continue to feel culturally disengaged from the health care system or from people of other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important issue when considering literacy among different populations is that different aspects of literacy may be more or less relevant for different cultural groups. Most studies use individuals' capacity to read print materials as a proxy for the broader and more complex construct of literacy. In some cultures, oral communication may be much more important than written, and the ability to read may be less relevant to self-efficacy and health. It is notable that Mexican immigrants to the United States generally have better health profiles than white Americans, despite lower literacy levels in general, and much lower English-language literacy levels. Moreover, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans tend to be less healthy than their first-generation counterparts, despite greater English proficiency and presumably higher literacy levels.17 Clearly, literacy cannot be thought of as a “magic bullet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These caveats notwithstanding, the evidence that improving literacy may be an effective means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health is sufficiently suggestive that interventions should be undertaken to test this hypothesis. Such trials will be the only way to definitively determine whether literacy is a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in health or merely a marker of other causal factors. The most promising interventions will be among patients with complex chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, where literacy and its potential impact on self-efficacy and health behaviors are most likely to have a positive effect.18 Outcomes that could be feasibly measured in a reasonable time frame would include intermediate measures such as glycohemoglobin levels and blood pressure, as well as functional status and health-related quality of life. In designing interventions, it is critical to remember that improving health literacy can be achieved not only by affording new skills to patients but also by reducing the literacy demand, or complexity, of health-related information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health inequalities are among the most pressing concerns for our profession and for the nation as a whole. We still have much to learn about the pathways we might use to reduce and eventually eliminate these disparities. One such pathway, however, seems promising enough that it warrants investment of our efforts and funding. It is time for studies of improving literacy as a means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health.\n",

You should also set the model.config.pad_token_id. The embed_tokens layer of the model is initialized withself.embed_tokens = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.hidden_size, self.config.padding_idx), which makes sure that encoding the padding token will output zeros, so passing it when initializing is recommended.\n",

      "Set reconcilliation supports the replication or syncing of data-sets, either because they were created independently, or because they have drifted out of sync because of downtime, network partitions, misconfigurations, etc. In the latter case, detecting and fixing these inconsistencies is sometimes called [anti-entropy repair](\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose two participants on a network each have a set of records that they have collected independently. Set-reconcilliation efficiently determines which records one side has that the other side doesn't, and vice versa. After the records that are missing have been determined, this information can be used to transfer the missing data items. The actual transfer is external to the negentropy protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there are many ways to do set reconcilliation, negentropy is based on [Aljoscha Meyer's method]( which has the advantage of being simple to explain and implement.\n",

      "4. All representations shall provide relevant helpers\n",
      "   1. Quaternions shall provide at a minimum a conjugate function and a \"short direction\" function\n",

      "\n",
      "This project was started by Tulio and then maintained mainly by him and I for a good number of years as we worked together on projects that used KafkaJS. Tulio no longer works at a company that uses KafkaJS, and while the company I work for does use KafkaJS, I myself don't. The amount of time and energy this project requires to be successful is more than I have the capacity for, given that it no longer really \"scratches my own itch\", and as a result I haven't been able to tend the garden for the past year or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I think the best thing to do is to put out a call for maintainers so that I can let go and give someone else the chance to take over the reigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you should know\n",
      "This package is used a lot, which means that changes must be well-considered and well tested. This is not the kind of project where you spend 30 seconds looking at a PR and then going \"lgtm\". As a maintainer I believe that helping land contributions is the most important thing you do, both for the technical well-being of the project but also to help attract new contributors and make existing ones stick around.\n",
      "The code-base itself is in a pretty good spot. Test coverage is good and I'd say the overall code quality is fine. What I see lacking most is a roadmap for future development and an idea of what KIPs have been implemented and not.\n",
      "There are no ongoing costs for CI or other infrastructure. We used to have a continuous long-running service that would test out beta releases of KafkaJS, which was dependent on an AWS sponsorship that has since expired. Everything else is running on Github Actions and Azure Devops Pipeline's free tier.\n",
      "The KafkaJS organization also contains a few supporting libraries. While it's great if you're willing to maintain those as well, I don't see that this needs to necessarily be the case.\n",
      "Becoming an expert at developing and using KafkaJS does open up opportunities for at least a side-gig if you want it to. Don't expect to quit your day job, but it can bring in some beer money if you're willing to spend some extra time helping folks out. Getting to talk to people in companies using KafkaJS has been quite the highlight, and I've gotten more than one job offer over the years because of it.\n",
      "I won't be 100% gone, at least in the mid term. My company still uses KafkaJS and so if there are security issues or features that we really need, I will most likely be involved to some degree. However, my goal would be to transition to a contributor more than a maintainer.\n",
      "To be perfectly clear, what this project needs is not more contributions, but project management in terms of adding new collaborators, making releases, deciding on what features to adopt and which not to, providing feedback to contributors etc. It's not about cranking out code but rather making sure that the project stays healthy over time, that new contributors have a good experience and that our users stay happy.\n",
      "How to become a maintainer\n",
      "First of all, I'm not actually the owner of this repository, so I can't hand out access to anyone. My idea would be to move the repository to the KafkaJS organization and add new maintainer(s) there. This will come with some practical things to sort out, like setting up NPM publish rights and so on, but it'll make it easier to manage the project in the long run. I haven't had a chance to run this past Tulio recently, but this was our plan when he stepped back some time ago, so I don't think it'll be an issue other than just taking some time to get set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, maintainership of a project like this isn't for someone's first open-source experience. While the license says that the code comes with no warranty, our users still place some trust in us, so I'm not about to betray that trust by handing the keys over to the first person willing to take them. If you do have some experience contributing to related open-source projects, or ideally even KafkaJS itself, then please leave a comment in this thread if you are interested in becoming a maintainer, along with some contact information.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to be a maintainer, but I still want to help out\n",
      "That's great. The best thing you can do is probably help out with issue triage. Even if you don't have the permission to close an issue or merge a PR, it still helps whoever is maintaining the project a lot if someone has done most of the work already by the time they get around to reviewing an issue or PR. You don't need any special permission to do this, and never have.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I would ask that you please don't do is @ me or Tulio with \"Any updates on this?\" or \"When will this be merged?\". I understand the frustration, but it causes a lot more stress and guilt than you might think, so please don't.\n",

      "Reviewing and helping contributors get their PRs merged (or rejected if they are not aligned with the project direction). This depends wildly on how complex the contribution is - sometimes it takes 5 minutes and sometimes it takes several hours over many weeks. It sucks when people contribute improvements but no one is able to take the time to land the change. I would say expect a couple of hours per week on average, but it's not always a steady stream.\n",
      "Making regular releases. Historically we've had a stabilization period where we've run beta releases in production to catch issues that slipped through CI, and then made a \"stable\" release when we feel confident, but this could change to a more continuous release schedule or whatever the maintainers feel is the most sustainable. The release process is mostly automated, but it definitely has some rough edges that could use a bit of work. It's the kind of thing you spend a few hours on once and then it just keeps working for a few years, so not a huge deal, but still needs doing.\n",
      "Triaging issues. I don't believe it's necessarily the maintainer's job to debug people's issues, but it is good to at least go through and close invalid issues, label things correctly and so on, just to avoid the issue tracker being a jungle. Again, this is a rabbithole where you can spend hours and hours if you really want to get to the bottom of issues, and perhaps an hour or two a week if you just want to make sure that each issue has at least been looked at and closed/labelled appropriately.\n",
      "Related to the first point - providing guidance on what needs to be done in order to implement some feature. Sometimes contributors just open an issue describing the feature they want, then independently implement the solution and it's all good, but most of the time it's their first time contributing to a Kafka client and they need some guidance to figure out how to plan their feature or just get feedback on their idea before implementing it. This doesn't need to be done by a maintainer, but people tend to look to you for this type of support, so be aware that it can be a timesink.\n",
      "Maintaining node versions and dependency upgrades - frankly very little time. We don't have any runtime dependencies, so there's not much to worry about. Maybe a few hours per year, whenever older Node versions become unsupported and we need to update our CI to match.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dispatch an event to the current repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dispatch an event to a remote repository using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Action inputs\n",
      "\n",
      "| Name | Description | Default |\n",
      "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
      "| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)]( See [token](#token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n",
      "| `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch. | `github.repository` (current repository) |\n",
      "| `event-type` | (**required**) A custom webhook event name. | |\n",
      "| `client-payload` | JSON payload with extra information about the webhook event that your action or workflow may use. | `{}` |\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Token\n",
      "\n",
      "This action creates [`repository_dispatch`]( events.\n",
      "The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` token can only be used if you are dispatching the same repository that the workflow is executing in.\n",
      "\n",
      "To dispatch to a remote repository you must create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)]( with the `repo` scope and store it as a secret.\n",
      "If you will be dispatching to a public repository then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use a [fine-grained personal access token]( (beta). It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:\n",
      " - `contents: read & write`\n",
      " - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Example\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example setting all of the input parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event.\n",
      "Note that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dispatch to multiple repositories\n",
      "\n",
      "You can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy]( In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Client payload\n",
      "\n",
      "The GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON.\n",
      "If you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property.\n",
      "The following payload will succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`. A very large payload may result in a `client_payload is too large` error.\n",

      "8th September 2023 - Guide , Nim , Programming\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently I was met with an interesting problem when wrapping a C library in Nim. The library in question was MAPM, an older but quite complete library for dealing with arbitrary precision maths. Unfortunately the library doesn’t have much in the way of error handling. If something goes wrong it almost always writes to stderr and returns the number 0. And to be fair, there isn’t a whole lot that can go wrong in this library. Pretty much every error scenario is bad input to functions like trying to divide by 0 or trying to get trigonometry results for impossible angles. However in the case where malloc/realloc isn’t able to allocate more data then it writes to stderr and then calls exit(100). This sounds pretty terrible, but as the author points out the alternative isn’t great either, and there are ways to work around it. I do wish that the author had opted to use error flags like many of the C standard library functions, this way it’d be easier to deal with these errors, but alas.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what do we do? I could add range checks to all inputs in my wrapper, which works, but isn’t great for performance. I could of course disable these when the user compiles with -d:danger like the Nim compiler itself does. But this still doesn’t feel like a great solution. And besides, MAPM does all these checks itself, so we’d be checking everything twice! Initially I wondered if it would be possible to read from the programs own stderr, or to replace stderr with a stream we could read from before calling MAPM functions and swap it back afterwards. But this seemed like a lot of hassle for quite small benefit.\n",
      "The solution: old C tricks\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily the library performs all this error handling with an internal function called M_apm_log_error_msg. This function takes two arguments, one which decides if it’s a fatal error and exit(100) should be called, and the other which contains the message to display. And as it turns out ld, the GNU linker which ships with gcc, has an option called --wrap and has this to say about it in the documentation:\n",

In EXPLORE step, explain different PIVOT_PATHs between start and target STR_CHOICE and show it on NETWORK graph. This can be done by breadth first search algorithm on NETWORK graph.

Intellectual property strategy focuses on gaining control of innovations through patents and trademarks, and collaborating to reduce costs and has examples like Harry Potter, gettyimages, xerox, DOLBY, INTELLECTUAL VENTURES, Genetech. Value chain strategy aims to be the preferred partner in a slice of an industry's value chain through strong execution and collaboration and has examples like Foxconn, PayPal, madaket, mattermark, DRIZLY, STRATACOM. Disruption strategy targets underserved segments and uses iteration and learning to expand and has examples like NETFLIX, Zipcar, salesforce, amazon, skype, oDesk. Architectural strategy creates an entirely new value chain by controlling a key resource or interface that coordinates multiple stakeholders to provide new consumer value and has examples like facebook, AngelList, ebay, Ford, Etsy, Dell. Pivoting happens in CTRL_SEG which affects OP_STATE in the long run. ENV is branched to INDUSTRY_CLOCKSPEED and INDUSTRY_TREND classes.
