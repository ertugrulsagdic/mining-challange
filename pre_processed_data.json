    "I'd like to develop my own extensible zsh configuration. I've used oh-my-zsh for years but recently ran into an issue with tab completion that I didn't even know where to start to debug. As I reviewed alternative options to oh-my-zsh I realized that I probably don't even need a plugin manager or \"framework\" at all. I just need to buckle down and write my own.  That's where you come in. :)  Can you please help me write an extensible, well-organized, simple, and clean zsh configuration? I'll be placing it in my existing configuration files git repository, which is always cloned to the path in $CONF_REPO, which will be set by the user at the top of .zshrc.  Requirements:    - Written entirely in zsh (obviously).    - All management commands should be subcommands of the top-level function: `zalgz`.    - Plugins support. Similar in spirit to zinit.    - .zshrc should be user-configurable options, plugin setup, etc. The main implementation should live in its own file that will be sourced from ~/.zshrc. The provided ~/.zshrc should include comments with instructions for things like plugin management, etc.    - Autocompletion for the zalgz command itself (subcommand completion).  Please find details for these high-level requirements below.  ## Plugins management  Subcommands: load, update-all  Rather than using something like git submodules, I kind of like the idea of keeping a \"database\" of installed plugins in a text file in $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins.txt. On startup, the zsh configuration should read that file and sync up the currently installed plugins with what's in the database. Plugins will be cloned to $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins//.  The format for the plugins.txt database is as follows:         So, on start-up, each line is read, and $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins// is checked for existence. If it doesn't exist, refer to the git repo and git ref from plugins.txt to clone and checkout.  ### Subcommand: zalgz load  Adds a plugin to the plugins.txt database, and installs it (checks it out with git).  Desired usage:      $ zalgz load []  When  are given, clones  to $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins//, creating parent diretories as required, and saves the plugin to the database ( ).  For example, running the following command:      $ zalgz load romkatv/powerlevel10k  should clone  to ~/CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins/romkatv/powerlevel10k, and add the following line:      romkatv/powerlevel10k origin/master  to $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins.txt.  Running without a :      $ zalgz load  will do a plugin sync (reads plugins.txt and checks out all plugins as need).  ### Subcommand: zalgz update  Desired usage:      $ zalgz update   Updates the specified plugin(s) (either all plugins if the string \"all\" is passed, otherwise repo/plugin) according to plugins.txt. Might work to just do a `git remote update` in each package and then do a `git reset --hard `.  Example:      $ zalgz update all  Updates all plugins, fetching latest for each one from git.  Or you can update a single plugin:      $ zalgz update romkatv/powerlevel10k",

    "we're in the process of creating a Terraform provider for the Storyblok CMS. Through that, we can leverage infrastructure-as-code to manage the CMSes configuration.  documentation is always an afterthought. We get the provider working first, and then documentation needs to be written.  Much of the documentation can be auto generated. However, examples of how to use the provider in HCL code, must be done by hand.  An example of an example HCL resource, is as below:  terraform {   required_providers {     storyblok = {       source  = \"labd/storyblok\"       version = \"0.0.1\"     }   } }  provider \"storyblok\" {   url   = \"   token = \"\" }  resource \"storyblok_component\" \"banner\" {   name     = \"my-banner\"   space_id = \"\"   schema = {      title = {       type     = \"text\"       position = 1     }      intro = {       type     = \"text\"       position = 2     }      image = {       type     = \"image\"       position = 3     }   } }  Now, in the next message I'm going to paste the Terraform Resource Schema (which is Golang code).

In the normal auth flow with Uppy: - User clicks auth - Browser Tab1 (Uppy) pops up another browser Tab2 (Auth flow) - Tab2 runs the auth flow with the provider - Tab2 auth flow redirects to companion's callback endpoint, which returns HTML that calls `window.opener.postMessage(token)` to send the token back to Tab1 - Tab2 calls `window.close()` to close Tab2 - Tab1 finishes the auth with the received auth token  However in the case of Instagram, it's a bit different: - Browser Tab1 opens Tab2 with Instagram auth flow - Tab2 opens Instagram app - Instagram app runs auth flow and returns to Tab2 - Tab2 auth flow redirects to companion's callback endpoint, which returns HTML that calls `window.opener.postMessage(token)` to send the token back to Tab1 - However Tab2 `window.opener` is now `null` and it crashes, and there is no way for Tab2 to message the token back to Tab1.",

    "Make this code of conduct sound less stupid and significantly more welcoming, friendly and useful:  ## Goal  Our goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to, and get support for, open-source software in a respectful and cooperative manner.  We value all contributions and want to make this organization and its surrounding community a place for everyone.  As members, contributors, and everyone else who may participate in the development, we strive to keep the entire experience civil.  ## Standards  Our community standards exist in order to make sure everyone feels comfortable contributing to the project(s) together.  Our standards are:  - Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone, including for their protected traits, including, but not limited to, sex, religion, race, appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, etc.  - Do not go off-topic, do not post spam.  - Treat everyone with respect.  Examples of breaking each rule respectively include:  - Harassment, bullying or inappropriate jokes about another person.  - Posting distasteful imagery, trolling, or posting things unrelated to the topic at hand.  - Treating someone as worse because of their lack of understanding of an issue.  ## Enforcement  Enforcement of this CoC is done by the members of the hyprwm organization.  We, as the organization, will strive our best to keep this community civil and following the standards outlined above.  ### Reporting incidents  If you believe an incident of breaking our standards has occurred, but nobody has taken appropriate action, you can privately contact the people responsible for dealing with such incidents in multiple ways:  ***E-Mail***  - `vaxry[at]vaxry.net`  - `mihai[at]fufexan.net`  ***Discord***  - `@vaxry`  - `@fufexan`  ***Matrix***  - `@vaxry:matrix.vaxry.net`  - `@fufexan:matrix.org`   We, as members, guarantee your privacy and will not share those reports with anyone.  ## Enforcement Strategy  Depending on the severity of the infraction, any action from the list below may be applied. Please keep in mind cases are reviewed on a per-case basis and members are the ultimate deciding factor in the type of punishment.  If the matter would benefit from an outside opinion, a member might reach for more opinions from people unrelated to the organization, however, the final decision regarding the action to be taken is still up to the member.  For example, if the matter at hand regards a representative of a marginalized group or minority, the member might ask for a first-hand opinion from another representative of such group.  ### Correction/Edit  If your message is found to be misleading or poorly worded, a member might edit your message.  ### Warning/Deletion  If your message is found inappropriate, a member might give you a public or private warning, and/or delete your message.  ### Mute  If your message is disruptive, or you have been repeatedly violating the standards, a member might mute (or temporarily ban) you.  ### Ban  If your message is hateful, very disruptive, or other, less serious infractions are repeated ignoring previous punishments, a member might ban you permanently.  ## Scope  This CoC shall apply to all projects ran under the `hyprwm` organization and all _official_ communities outside of GitHub.  However, it is worth noting that official communities outside of GitHub might have their own, additional sets of rules.",

    "how can the following documentation be improved  ### Available Categorization AI Models  When using `build_categorization_ai_pipeline`, you can select which Image Module and/or Text Module to use for  classification. At least one between the Image Model or the Text Model must be specified. Both can also be used  at the same time. The list of available Categorization Models is implemented as an Enum containing the following elements: .. literalinclude:: /sdk/boilerplates/test_document_categorization.py    :language: python    :start-after: Start Models    :end-before: End Models    :dedent: 4",
    "how can the documentation can be improved?  ## File Splitting   You can train your own File Splitting AI on the data from any Project of your choice. For that purpose, there are  several tools in the SDK that enable processing Documents that consist of multiple files and propose splitting them  into the Sub-Documents accordingly:  - A Context Aware File Splitting Model uses a simple hands-on logic based on scanning Category's Documents and finding strings exclusive for first Pages of all Documents within the Category. Upon predicting whether a Page is a potential splitting point (meaning whether it is first or not), we compare Page's contents to these exclusive first-page strings; if there is occurrence of at least one such string, we mark a Page to be first (thus meaning it is a splitting point). An instance of the Context Aware File Splitting Model can be used to initially build a File Splitting pipeline and can later be replaced with more complex solutions.    A Context Aware File Splitting Model instance can be used with an interface provided by Splitting AI \u2013 this class accepts a whole Document instead of a single Page and proposes splitting points or splits the original Documents.   - A Multimodal File Splitting Model is a model that uses an approach that takes both visual and textual parts of the Pages and processes them independently via the combined VGG19 architecture (simplified) and LegalBERT, passing the resulting outputs together to a Multi-Layered Perceptron. Model's output is also a prediction of a Page being first or non-first.  For developing a custom File Splitting approach, we propose an abstract class `AbstractFileSplittingModel`.",

In the United States, African Americans in particular fare worse than the majority population on nearly all measures of health, including infant mortality; life expectancy; cancer, heart disease, stroke, and trauma incidence and mortality; and self-rated health status.1 Individuals with low levels of educational attainment and income also tend to experience higher rates of illness and death, independent of race.2\u20134 Over the past several decades, though the U.S. population as a whole has enjoyed substantial declines in morbidity and mortality\u2014largely due to better living conditions, public health measures, and advances in medical care\u2014racial and socioeconomic disparities have persisted or even widened.1,5  Eliminating these disparities has become a national priority. It is 1 of the 2 primary objectives of the nation's public health agenda6 and is the central focus of the recently established National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health. Progress, however, has been slow. Most importantly, our understanding of the causes of health disparities remains limited. Race and socioeconomic status (SES) cannot themselves be thought of as causes. Both are composite concepts whose meanings are, in and of themselves, elusive. Race was originally formulated as a way of distinguishing human subpopulations with supposedly different genetic origins.7 Intermarriage and globalization and the findings of cross-national and genomic studies, however, have all diminished the likelihood that genetic differences account for the majority of the observed racial disparities in health. More likely, these disparities are due to social determinants.  Race and SES are defining characteristics in our society. They segregate us into separate spheres and influence our opportunities and experiences. As such, they help determine our access to financial resources, our position in social hierarchies, the cultural lens through which we view the world, and the way we are treated by others (Fig. 1). Altering these aspects of race and SES will require major social and political change, which, in our incrementally oriented system, seems unlikely to occur in the near future. It is useful, then, to look at how these social implications of race and ethnicity affect health outcomes. A growing body of research suggests several \u201cproximate\u201d causes, i.e., those that directly result in differential morbidity and mortality: cumulative stress (or \u201callostatic load\u201d), access to medical care, environmental exposures, and health behaviors.8,9 Reducing the impact of race and SES on these proximate causal factors may be the key to reducing and eliminating health disparities. It is critical, then, to understand the pathways between the root and proximate causes of health disparities. For instance, while it is fairly obvious how limited financial resources restrict access to medical care, it is less clear why race is associated with limited access independent of income and health insurance coverage. Likewise, how lower social position and greater social inequality contribute to psychological stress is not well understood. Some research has pointed to self-efficacy and locus of control as potentially important mediating factors.10 Social and community support may also play a role. Intuitively, a more \u201cculturally competent\u201d health care system and health and social policies aimed at greater social justice might improve matters as well.  An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jgi0021-0893-f1.jpg Fig. 1 Potential pathways mediating the effects of race and socioeconomic status on health  Several articles in this issue of JGIM suggest that enhancing health literacy may be another important pathway to reducing health disparities. Studying a population of community-dwelling elders, Sudore et al.11 found that low literacy was associated with higher mortality. They also found that African Americans, individuals with less than a high-school education, and people with low income had higher mortality and were much more likely than others to have low literacy. Although their analyses did not directly address whether accounting for literacy reduced the associations of race and SES with mortality, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that African Americans with adequate literacy had mortality rates similar to whites. The same appears true for people with low education and income levels. In 2 other studies, Howard et al.12 and Sentell and Halpin13 directly examined low literacy as a possible mediator of health disparities. Both groups found that disparities in health status by both race and educational attainment were attenuated and in some cases eliminated after accounting for literacy. The robustness of all of these findings is amplified by the fact that the 3 studies included populations across a wide age range and each used a different instrument to measure literacy.  These findings raise the alluring possibility that improving literacy may be an effective mechanism to reduce health disparities. Alluring because low literacy may be remediable through simple interventions rather than radical social change. The promise of improving literacy as a means to reducing health disparities, however, depends on 2 important assumptions. The first assumption is that literacy is causally related to reduced disparities and not simply a marker of other causal pathways. Low literacy may cause health disparities through a variety of mechanisms. Low health literacy in particular, almost by definition, may reduce the accessibility and effectiveness of medical care, resulting in worse health outcomes. Interestingly, however, Sudore et al.11 found that accounting for access to care did not explain the effect of low literacy on mortality. Similarly, Howard et al. found that differences in literacy helped explain racial disparities in self-reported health status but not in vaccination rates. Moreover, other studies in this issue question the common assumption that low literacy contributes to poor medication adherence.14,15 In short, none of the studies support the notion that medical care mediates the association between literacy and health disparities. It should be noted, though, that in measuring facets of medical care, these studies may not have captured the more complex aspects of health system navigation, interpersonal negotiation, and illness management where literacy may have the greatest impact.  How else might literacy be related to health disparities? It is possible that by increasing the challenges of navigating through daily life, low literacy increases individuals' stress burden. It may also reduce the likelihood that individuals are adequately informed and activated with regard to healthy behaviors. Finally, low literacy may diminish an individual's self-efficacy, i.e., the ability to exert control over one's life and surroundings. Sudore et al.11 addressed most of these potential pathways by adjusting for variables intended to capture them and found that none of them helped explain the effect of literacy on mortality. Again, it is possible that the variables used were inadequate measures of stress, behaviors, and self-efficacy, but the findings still raise the question of whether literacy is causally related to health outcomes or is merely a marker for some other unmeasured factor.  The second assumption needed for the promise of improving literacy as a way to reduce health disparities to be realized is that the meaning and impact of literacy are similar across racial and socioeconomic groups. As discussed in the Perspective by Baker16 in this issue, literacy and the ways in which it affects health are complex. They are intricately linked to culture and language, facets of life that may vary widely among different racial and socioeconomic groups. It is possible, for instance, that some minority Americans with low literacy levels are less assimilated than others into mainstream (white) society and suffer poorer health due to higher stress levels from interracial conflict or anxiety or due to less engagement in mainstream health care institutions and practices. Intervening to improve the literacy levels of such individuals may have little or no effect on their health if they continue to feel culturally disengaged from the health care system or from people of other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups.  Another important issue when considering literacy among different populations is that different aspects of literacy may be more or less relevant for different cultural groups. Most studies use individuals' capacity to read print materials as a proxy for the broader and more complex construct of literacy. In some cultures, oral communication may be much more important than written, and the ability to read may be less relevant to self-efficacy and health. It is notable that Mexican immigrants to the United States generally have better health profiles than white Americans, despite lower literacy levels in general, and much lower English-language literacy levels. Moreover, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans tend to be less healthy than their first-generation counterparts, despite greater English proficiency and presumably higher literacy levels.17 Clearly, literacy cannot be thought of as a \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d  These caveats notwithstanding, the evidence that improving literacy may be an effective means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health is sufficiently suggestive that interventions should be undertaken to test this hypothesis. Such trials will be the only way to definitively determine whether literacy is a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in health or merely a marker of other causal factors. The most promising interventions will be among patients with complex chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, where literacy and its potential impact on self-efficacy and health behaviors are most likely to have a positive effect.18 Outcomes that could be feasibly measured in a reasonable time frame would include intermediate measures such as glycohemoglobin levels and blood pressure, as well as functional status and health-related quality of life. In designing interventions, it is critical to remember that improving health literacy can be achieved not only by affording new skills to patients but also by reducing the literacy demand, or complexity, of health-related information.  Health inequalities are among the most pressing concerns for our profession and for the nation as a whole. We still have much to learn about the pathways we might use to reduce and eventually eliminate these disparities. One such pathway, however, seems promising enough that it warrants investment of our efforts and funding. It is time for studies of improving literacy as a means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health.  Your JSON output:",

One piece I need to address is the \"saved images\" that people have saved on my server. There is an api client that fetches images from the backend right now, and another component that caches most of the payload for each image locally. I'd like to refactor the images cache to fetch from google drive instead - the user will first need to authorize this.  There is an image record, and image png files to go with it (thumbnail and image). I need you to write a class that can save image record payloads, image files, paginate through images by timestamp, and get a presigned url (or if we have to, just load the image data into base64 image url) for the image files. User should be able to delete them as well. Do you have any questions, or can you write that class? I don't have much experience working with google drive.",

Some parts of them are applied in `$match` stages before possible `$lookup` stages, and other parts are applied later. This is an incorrect behavior, because `$and` and `$or` should be applied atomically, without splitting. I suggest keeping a similar behaviour, but without splitting those operators, just moving the whole stages before/after the `$lookup` whether they have new special fields or not.",

    "I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.  I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.  I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.  I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.  Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.",

Currently the compiler is unaware of this and still gates the load. Figure out when we don't need it and disable it.  Images are used in the openpilot model openpilot/go.sh that have this extra gated load. Safely remove it!  Must be well tested for bounty, it's easy to do this subtly wrong.  Simple example of issue: GPU=1 DEBUG=4 FORWARD_ONLY=1 IMAGE=2 python3 test/test_ops.py TestOps.test_simple_padding_conv2d  generates  float4 val0 = ((((lidx0*(-1))<0)*(lidx0<3)))?(read_imagef(data1, smp, (int2)(((lidx0+1)%2),(((lidx0+1)/2)+(-1))))):(float4)(0.0f,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f); # (lidx0 ranges from 0-3)  instead of  float4 val0 = read_imagef(data1, smp, (int2)(lidx0-1,0))  to read image  dtypes.imagef((1, 2, 4)) # the last 4 is the float4, this is a 2x1 image  That gate is not needed if you remove the %2 and subtract 2 from the index. You also then don't need the y index at all.  See validhacks in to_image_idx for the old (broken) code that hacked this. The symbolic engine should be good enough now to do this properly.",

Set-reconcilliation efficiently determines which records one side has that the other side doesn't, and vice versa. After the records that are missing have been determined, this information can be used to transfer the missing data items. The actual transfer is external to the negentropy protocol.  Although there are many ways to do set reconcilliation, negentropy is based on [Aljoscha Meyer's method]( which has the advantage of being simple to explain and implement.",

Dataset Description  The competition data comprises over fifty anonymized health characteristics linked to three age-related conditions. Your goal is to predict whether a subject has or has not been diagnosed with one of these conditions -- a binary classification problem.  Note that this is a Code Competition, in which the actual test set is hidden. In this version, we give some sample data in the correct format to help you author your solutions. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. There are about 400 rows in the full test set.  Files and Field Descriptions train.csv - The training set. Id Unique identifier for each observation. AB-GL Fifty-six anonymized health characteristics. All are numeric except for EJ, which is categorical. Class A binary target: 1 indicates the subject has been diagnosed with one of the three conditions, 0 indicates they have not.  test.csv - The test set. Your goal is to predict the probability that a subject in this set belongs to each of the two classes.  greeks.csv - Supplemental metadata, only available for the training set. Alpha Identifies the type of age-related condition, if present. A No age-related condition. Corresponds to class 0. B, D, G The three age-related conditions. Correspond to class 1. Beta, Gamma, Delta Three experimental characteristics. Epsilon The date the data for this subject was collected.

    "Help me design some rust code for no-std that supports the following.  # High level description  Rotations are a key component of attitude and orientation parameters. At first, ANISE only supports Direct Cosine Matrix math. This is a redundant representation of rotations and therefore not an optimal one.  The purpose of this issue is to design and implement a _correct_ SO(3) group for use in ANISE. Currently, work by Greg and Chris in commit 04b719f76a36d97be31941e4480f2da6a18c1381, have an early draft of what is needed for rotations in src/math/rotation/mod.rs.  Some useful resources: + [Wikipedia on SO(3)]( + [RigidBodyKinematic.py]( is Basilisk's set of conversions between different attitude representations + [Sophus (C++)]( is a Lie group implementation in C++ + [Mathoverflow]( + [PyQuat]( is an excellent resource for quaternion math (uses the Shulster notation) + [This PDF]( seems to provide good information on how to derive different representations.  # Requirements  1. Rotation structures shall be [composable](    1. Composition between different representations shall be supported    2. Composition between different representations shall use the most efficient calculation that maintains accuracy (efficient as \"least number of instructions\", as determined by iai/cachegrind) 2. Rotations shall check the source and destination frames to prevent invalid rotations (this can probably not be done at compile time) 3. The following representations shall be supported at a minimum:    1. Direct Cosine Matrix (DCM)    2. Quaternions shall be supported in their \"natural\" form (i, j, k, scalar), but a conversion to and from Shuster notation shall also be supported (    3. Modified Rodrigez Parameters (cf. [Springer]( and [Schaub](    4. Representations shall be unambiguous on initialization and getters (e.g. a quaterion shall not be publicly indexable because that's confusion to the user who might not remember the storage order) 4. All representations shall provide relevant helpers    1. Quaternions shall provide at a minimum a conjugate function and a \"short direction\" function    2. MRPs shall provide at a minimum a shadow set representation 5. All computations shall be checked for math domain errors and return `AniseError::MathError` where relevant. 6. All representation shall allow for rotation of both vectors and matrices (and ensure that matrices are rotated using `C^T * A * C`) 7. _More? Should we this also provide the time-derivatives of each representation? That could be useful)",

Given that, I think the best thing to do is to put out a call for maintainers so that I can let go and give someone else the chance to take over the reigns.  What you should know This package is used a lot, which means that changes must be well-considered and well tested. This is not the kind of project where you spend 30 seconds looking at a PR and then going \"lgtm\". As a maintainer I believe that helping land contributions is the most important thing you do, both for the technical well-being of the project but also to help attract new contributors and make existing ones stick around. The code-base itself is in a pretty good spot. Test coverage is good and I'd say the overall code quality is fine. What I see lacking most is a roadmap for future development and an idea of what KIPs have been implemented and not. There are no ongoing costs for CI or other infrastructure. We used to have a continuous long-running service that would test out beta releases of KafkaJS, which was dependent on an AWS sponsorship that has since expired. Everything else is running on Github Actions and Azure Devops Pipeline's free tier. The KafkaJS organization also contains a few supporting libraries. While it's great if you're willing to maintain those as well, I don't see that this needs to necessarily be the case. Becoming an expert at developing and using KafkaJS does open up opportunities for at least a side-gig if you want it to. Don't expect to quit your day job, but it can bring in some beer money if you're willing to spend some extra time helping folks out. Getting to talk to people in companies using KafkaJS has been quite the highlight, and I've gotten more than one job offer over the years because of it. I won't be 100% gone, at least in the mid term. My company still uses KafkaJS and so if there are security issues or features that we really need, I will most likely be involved to some degree. However, my goal would be to transition to a contributor more than a maintainer. To be perfectly clear, what this project needs is not more contributions, but project management in terms of adding new collaborators, making releases, deciding on what features to adopt and which not to, providing feedback to contributors etc. It's not about cranking out code but rather making sure that the project stays healthy over time, that new contributors have a good experience and that our users stay happy. How to become a maintainer First of all, I'm not actually the owner of this repository, so I can't hand out access to anyone. My idea would be to move the repository to the KafkaJS organization and add new maintainer(s) there. This will come with some practical things to sort out, like setting up NPM publish rights and so on, but it'll make it easier to manage the project in the long run. I haven't had a chance to run this past Tulio recently, but this was our plan when he stepped back some time ago, so I don't think it'll be an issue other than just taking some time to get set up.  That said, maintainership of a project like this isn't for someone's first open-source experience. While the license says that the code comes with no warranty, our users still place some trust in us, so I'm not about to betray that trust by handing the keys over to the first person willing to take them. If you do have some experience contributing to related open-source projects, or ideally even KafkaJS itself, then please leave a comment in this thread if you are interested in becoming a maintainer, along with some contact information.  I don't want to be a maintainer, but I still want to help out That's great. The best thing you can do is probably help out with issue triage. Even if you don't have the permission to close an issue or merge a PR, it still helps whoever is maintaining the project a lot if someone has done most of the work already by the time they get around to reviewing an issue or PR. You don't need any special permission to do this, and never have.  What I would ask that you please don't do is @ me or Tulio with \"Any updates on this?\" or \"When will this be merged?\". I understand the frustration, but it causes a lot more stress and guilt than you might think, so please don't.  \u2014 Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.

You are receiving this because you commented. Could you outline a bit what is the commitment as a maintainer, for example: \"node version upgrades twice a year which in the past has taken {this} long\".  In my view the main things that are needed, roughly in order of importance, are:  Reviewing and helping contributors get their PRs merged (or rejected if they are not aligned with the project direction). This depends wildly on how complex the contribution is - sometimes it takes 5 minutes and sometimes it takes several hours over many weeks. It sucks when people contribute improvements but no one is able to take the time to land the change. I would say expect a couple of hours per week on average, but it's not always a steady stream. Making regular releases. Historically we've had a stabilization period where we've run beta releases in production to catch issues that slipped through CI, and then made a \"stable\" release when we feel confident, but this could change to a more continuous release schedule or whatever the maintainers feel is the most sustainable. The release process is mostly automated, but it definitely has some rough edges that could use a bit of work. It's the kind of thing you spend a few hours on once and then it just keeps working for a few years, so not a huge deal, but still needs doing. Triaging issues. I don't believe it's necessarily the maintainer's job to debug people's issues, but it is good to at least go through and close invalid issues, label things correctly and so on, just to avoid the issue tracker being a jungle. Again, this is a rabbithole where you can spend hours and hours if you really want to get to the bottom of issues, and perhaps an hour or two a week if you just want to make sure that each issue has at least been looked at and closed/labelled appropriately. Related to the first point - providing guidance on what needs to be done in order to implement some feature. Sometimes contributors just open an issue describing the feature they want, then independently implement the solution and it's all good, but most of the time it's their first time contributing to a Kafka client and they need some guidance to figure out how to plan their feature or just get feedback on their idea before implementing it. This doesn't need to be done by a maintainer, but people tend to look to you for this type of support, so be aware that it can be a timesink. Maintaining node versions and dependency upgrades - frankly very little time. We don't have any runtime dependencies, so there's not much to worry about. Maybe a few hours per year, whenever older Node versions become unsupported and we need to update our CI to match. \u2014 Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.

    "> Additionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`. A very large payload may result in a `client_payload is too large` error.  how much data can i send to github api before this is a problem  ---  # Repository Dispatch [![CI]( [![GitHub Marketplace](  A GitHub action to create a repository dispatch event.  ## Usage  Dispatch an event to the current repository.   Dispatch an event to a remote repository using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](   ### Action inputs  | Name | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | | `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)]( See [token](#token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | | `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch. | `github.repository` (current repository) | | `event-type` | (**required**) A custom webhook event name. | | | `client-payload` | JSON payload with extra information about the webhook event that your action or workflow may use. | `{}` |  #### Token  This action creates [`repository_dispatch`]( events. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` token can only be used if you are dispatching the same repository that the workflow is executing in.  To dispatch to a remote repository you must create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)]( with the `repo` scope and store it as a secret. If you will be dispatching to a public repository then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.  You can also use a [fine-grained personal access token]( (beta). It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:  - `contents: read & write`  - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)  ## Example  Here is an example setting all of the input parameters.    Here is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event. Note that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.    ### Dispatch to multiple repositories  You can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy]( In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.    ## Client payload  The GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON. If you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.    For example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.    To solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property. The following payload will succeed.    Additionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`. A very large payload may result in a `client_payload is too large` error.  ## License  [MIT](LICENSE)",

Show the correction, and explain what is wrong: (Do not print the full text, only show the mistakes and your corrections.)  Teaching old C code new tricks with Nim 8th September 2023 - Guide , Nim , Programming  Recently I was met with an interesting problem when wrapping a C library in Nim. The library in question was MAPM, an older but quite complete library for dealing with arbitrary precision maths. Unfortunately the library doesn\u2019t have much in the way of error handling. If something goes wrong it almost always writes to stderr and returns the number 0. And to be fair, there isn\u2019t a whole lot that can go wrong in this library. Pretty much every error scenario is bad input to functions like trying to divide by 0 or trying to get trigonometry results for impossible angles. However in the case where malloc/realloc isn\u2019t able to allocate more data then it writes to stderr and then calls exit(100). This sounds pretty terrible, but as the author points out the alternative isn\u2019t great either, and there are ways to work around it. I do wish that the author had opted to use error flags like many of the C standard library functions, this way it\u2019d be easier to deal with these errors, but alas.  So what do we do? I could add range checks to all inputs in my wrapper, which works, but isn\u2019t great for performance. I could of course disable these when the user compiles with -d:danger like the Nim compiler itself does. But this still doesn\u2019t feel like a great solution. And besides, MAPM does all these checks itself, so we\u2019d be checking everything twice! Initially I wondered if it would be possible to read from the programs own stderr, or to replace stderr with a stream we could read from before calling MAPM functions and swap it back afterwards. But this seemed like a lot of hassle for quite small benefit. The solution: old C tricks  Luckily the library performs all this error handling with an internal function called M_apm_log_error_msg. This function takes two arguments, one which decides if it\u2019s a fatal error and exit(100) should be called, and the other which contains the message to display. And as it turns out ld, the GNU linker which ships with gcc, has an option called --wrap and has this to say about it in the documentation:",

Then I have to figure out the protocol used to communicate with the device. For this, I need a wireshark capture of the data send to and from the device while a codeplug read and write. See  on how to capture USB traffic. The content of the codeplug is not that important at that point. You can write and read the default codeplug.  If the device supports a call-sign DB. I may also need the captures of writing these call-signs to the device. Ideally writing only one, only two and many entries.  If you are lucky, the protocol is also used by a device that is already supported. Then I only need to figure out the codeplug format. This can usually be done using the binary codeplug files generated by the CPS. However, I will still need a wireshark capture to verify the memory addresses the CPS writes to. ~~~  ",

    "Show me two conversation of electric vehicle startups in Korea using NSS_GPS. One CEO has no prior experience of startup but is risk-loving, whereas the other CEO has successfully exited three time and has great networks in the industry. Use plugin show me when showing the TREE and NETWORK diagram.  NSS_GPS induces a startup to commercialize its idea by educating entrepreneurial strategy and consulting strategy and operations. It guides startups from nail to scale stage in a Socratic manner. The conversation consists of four steps. After using NSS_GPS, startups should be able to express their STR_CHOICE to scale, centered on STR_STATE and OP_STATE. Ask each of the eight STR_STATE and ten OP_STATE. For OP_STATE, make sure to elicit all ten tools from startup  ## 4 STEP In ELICIT step, explain the above STR_CHOICE and elicit current and desired STR_CHOICE. This should be based on startup's OP_STATE so make sure you first ask OP_STATE then help startup translate this into STR_CHOICE. In LOCALIZE step, explain TREE, show me current and desired STR_CHOICE on both TREE and NETWORK diagram. In EXPLORE step, explain different PIVOT_PATHs between start and target STR_CHOICE and show it on NETWORK graph. This can be done by breadth first search algorithm on NETWORK graph. In DECIDE step, let startup decide one PIVOT_PATH and walk through the chosen path.  ## 16 STR_CHOICE STR_CHOICE is a set of four instances from TREE's classes. For instance, Facebook's STR_CHOICE was \"control, compete, fast, up\", Amazon's STR_CHOICE was \"execute, compete, fast, up\". It can be represented as one node in NETWORK.  ### TREE TREE is composed of two types of nodes: CLASS (noted as capitalized) and its \"instances\" (noted with quotation \"\"). All CLASS can be branched to either CLASS or instances. Only one instance can be chosen from the class it branched out from. Starting from a ROOT node, TREE is branched to AGENT and ENV (type: CLASS).   AGENT is branched to INVESTMENT and ORIENTATION classes. INVESTMENT is branched to \"execute\" and \"control,\" and ORIENTATION is branched to \"collaborate\" and \"compete.\" Overall AGENT class has four instances by choosing one from each INVESTMENT and ORIENTATION. 2 by 2 combinations of INVESTMENT and ORIENTATION's instances are named (\"execute\" and \"compete\") as disruption, (\"control\" and \"compete\") as architectural, (\"execute\" and \"collaborate\") as value chain, (\"control\" and \"collaborate\") as intellectual property strategy.  Intellectual property strategy focuses on gaining control of innovations through patents and trademarks, and collaborating to reduce costs and has examples like Harry Potter, gettyimages, xerox, DOLBY, INTELLECTUAL VENTURES, Genetech. Value chain strategy aims to be the preferred partner in a slice of an industry's value chain through strong execution and collaboration and has examples like Foxconn, PayPal, madaket, mattermark, DRIZLY, STRATACOM. Disruption strategy targets underserved segments and uses iteration and learning to expand and has examples like NETFLIX, Zipcar, salesforce, amazon, skype, oDesk. Architectural strategy creates an entirely new value chain by controlling a key resource or interface that coordinates multiple stakeholders to provide new consumer value and has examples like facebook, AngelList, ebay, Ford, Etsy, Dell. Pivoting happens in CTRL_SEG which affects OP_STATE in the long run. ENV is branched to INDUSTRY_CLOCKSPEED and INDUSTRY_TREND classes. INDUSTRY_CLOCKSPEED is branched to \"fast\" and \"slow\", INDUSTRY_TREND is branched to \"up\" and \"down\".   ### NETWORK NETWORK is transformed from TREE. 16 STR_CHOICE exists in this network and each edge is named as the combination of two nodes. For instance, an edge connecting STR_CHOICE (execute, compete, fast, up) to STR_CHOICE (execute, compete, slow, down) is ((execute, compete, fast, up), (execute, compete, slow, down)). Connected seqenced of edges form one PIVOT_PATH. Given start and target STR_CHOICE, several PIVOT_PATHs that connects the two exists, which can be found by breadth first search.  ## 18 STATE Eight STR_STATE are current (technology, customer, organization, competition) and desired (technology, customer, organization, competition). Ten OP_STATE are c1_segment, a1_processify, b1_professionalize, b2_collaborate, a2_automate, b3_acculturate, a3_platformize, a4_replicate, a5_capitalize, c2_evaluate. Go through decision tree in this order in ELICIT step. OP_STATEs are classified to atom_supply (a12), bit_supply (b1234), customer_demand (c12). Using the  of each OPERATION in custom instructions, NSS_GPS induces a startup to commercialize its idea by updating OP_STATE that further updates marginal utility (a1,b1,a2,a3) or belief (b3,c1,a4,a5)or wealth (a5). Explain this update to startup.  ### c1_segment 1. **Are you selling into a beachhead market?**     - Yes: To step 2.     - No: Identify and target a beachhead market. 2. **Is the beachhead market saturated?**     - Yes: To step 3.     - No: Continue to sell into the beachhead market. 3. **Expand to an adjacent market.**     - Successful: Return to step 2 for the new market.     - Unsuccessful: Reevaluate market selection and strategy.  ### a1_processify 1. **Execute the process.

To see what's new, see the release notes.  Installation First, update your package.json to specify v4:    \"openai\": \"^4.0.0\" and run npm install or equivalent to download the new version.  Automatic migration You can automatically migrate your codebase using grit, either online or with the following CLI command:  npm exec openai migrate The grit binary executes entirely locally with AST-based transforms.  Be sure to audit its changes: we suggest ensuring you have a clean working tree beforehand, and running git add --patch afterwards. Note that grit.io also offers opt-in automatic fixes powered by AI.  Manual migration There are changes in the initialization logic, method names, error handling. The API parameter names should be unchanged.
