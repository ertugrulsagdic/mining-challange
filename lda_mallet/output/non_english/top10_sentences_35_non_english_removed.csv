I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.\n\nI'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.\n\nI have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.\n\nI'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.\n\nHopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.""]"

Show the correction, and explain what is wrong: (Do not print the full text, only show the mistakes and your corrections.)\n\nTeaching old C code new tricks with Nim\n8th September 2023 - Guide , Nim , Programming\n\nRecently I was met with an interesting problem when wrapping a C library in Nim. The library in question was MAPM, an older but quite complete library for dealing with arbitrary precision maths. Unfortunately the library doesn’t have much in the way of error handling. If something goes wrong it almost always writes to stderr and returns the number 0. And to be fair, there isn’t a whole lot that can go wrong in this library. Pretty much every error scenario is bad input to functions like trying to divide by 0 or trying to get trigonometry results for impossible angles. However in the case where malloc/realloc isn’t able to allocate more data then it writes to stderr and then calls exit(100). This sounds pretty terrible, but as the author points out the alternative isn’t great either, and there are ways to work around it. I do wish that the author had opted to use error flags like many of the C standard library functions, this way it’d be easier to deal with these errors, but alas.\n\nSo what do we do? I could add range checks to all inputs in my wrapper, which works, but isn’t great for performance. I could of course disable these when the user compiles with -d:danger like the Nim compiler itself does. But this still doesn’t feel like a great solution. And besides, MAPM does all these checks itself, so we’d be checking everything twice! Initially I wondered if it would be possible to read from the programs own stderr, or to replace stderr with a stream we could read from before calling MAPM functions and swap it back afterwards. But this seemed like a lot of hassle for quite small benefit.\nThe solution: old C tricks\n\nLuckily the library performs all this error handling with an internal function called M_apm_log_error_msg. This function takes two arguments, one which decides if it’s a fatal error and exit(100) should be called, and the other which contains the message to display. And as it turns out ld, the GNU linker which ships with gcc, has an option called --wrap and has this to say about it in the documentation:']"

I\'m working in a react/typescript application that allows users to generate images with AI, and I\'m working on removing what remains of the backend. One piece I need to address is the ""saved images"" that people have saved on my server. There is an api client that fetches images from the backend right now, and another component that caches most of the payload for each image locally. I\'d like to refactor the images cache to fetch from google drive instead - the user will first need to authorize this.\n\nThere is an image record, and image png files to go with it (thumbnail and image). I need you to write a class that can save image record payloads, image files, paginate through images by timestamp, and get a presigned url (or if we have to, just load the image data into base64 image url) for the image files. User should be able to delete them as well. Do you have any questions, or can you write that class? I don\'t have much experience working with google drive.']"

For that purpose, there are \nseveral tools in the SDK that enable processing Documents that consist of multiple files and propose splitting them \ninto the Sub-Documents accordingly:\n\n- A Context Aware File Splitting Model uses a simple hands-on logic based on scanning Category's Documents and finding\nstrings exclusive for first Pages of all Documents within the Category. Upon predicting whether a Page is a potential\nsplitting point (meaning whether it is first or not), we compare Page's contents to these exclusive first-page strings;\nif there is occurrence of at least one such string, we mark a Page to be first (thus meaning it is a splitting point).\nAn instance of the Context Aware File Splitting Model can be used to initially build a File Splitting pipeline and can\nlater be replaced with more complex solutions.\n\n  A Context Aware File Splitting Model instance can be used with an interface provided by Splitting AI – this class\naccepts a whole Document instead of a single Page and proposes splitting points or splits the original Documents.\n\n\n- A Multimodal File Splitting Model is a model that uses an approach that takes both visual and textual parts of the\nPages and processes them independently via the combined VGG19 architecture (simplified) and LegalBERT, passing the\nresulting outputs together to a Multi-Layered Perceptron. Model's output is also a prediction of a Page being first or\nnon-first.\n\nFor developing a custom File Splitting approach, we propose an abstract class `AbstractFileSplittingModel`.""]"

The three courses I taught different versions of were differential equations, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus.\nSkills: Mathematical Modeling · Classroom Instruction · Curriculum Development\n\nUniversity of Toronto logo\nUniversity of TorontoUniversity of Toronto\nMaster's degree, MathematicsMaster's degree, Mathematics\n2007 - 20092007 - 2009\nCanada Graduate Scholarships – Doctoral (CGS D)\nCanada Graduate Scholarships – Master’s (CGS M)Canada Graduate Scholarships – Doctoral (CGS D) Canada Graduate Scholarships – Master’s (CGS M)\nSkills: Research · MathematicsSkills: Research · Mathematics\nGeorge Brown College logo\nGeorge Brown CollegeGeorge Brown College\nGraduate Certificate, Analytics for Business Decision MakingGraduate Certificate, Analytics for Business Decision Making\n2018 - 20192018 - 2019\nBroad exposure to data analysis from the business perspective, including SAS and SQL, marketing and business research, financial statement analysis, applications of machine learning, and data modeling and project methodology.Broad exposure to data analysis from the business perspective, including SAS and SQL, marketing and business research, financial statement analysis, applications of machine learning, and data modeling and project methodology.…see more\nSkills: Business Analytics · Data Analysis · SAS · SQLSkills: Business Analytics · Data Analysis · SAS · SQL\nCarleton University logo\nCarleton UniversityCarleton University\nBachelor's degree, MathematicsBachelor's degree, Mathematics\n2003 - 20072003 - 2007\nUniversity Medal in MathematicsUniversity Medal in Mathematics\nSkills: Mathematics\n\nedX logo\nedX Verified Certificate for Automata TheoryedX Verified Certificate for Automata Theory\nedXedX\nIssued Aug 2023Issued Aug 2023\nCredential ID 4ad76d04e8fc418ab10daed7c7904299\n\nCoursera logo\nGoogle Data Analytics CertificateGoogle Data Analytics Certificate\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued Jul 2023\n\nCoursera logo\nData Science with Databricks for Data Analysts by DatabricksData Science with Databricks for Data Analysts by Databricks\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued Jun 2023\n\nSnowflake logo\nHands On Essentials - Data EngineeringHands On Essentials - Data Engineering\nSnowflakeSnowflake\nIssued Jun 2023\n\nCoursera logo\nAWS Fundamentals by Amazon Web ServicesAWS Fundamentals by Amazon Web Services\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued May 2023\n\nCoursera logo\nGoogle IT Support Professional CertificateGoogle IT Support Professional Certificate\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued May 2023\n\nCoursera logo\nModern Big Data Analysis with SQL by ClouderaModern Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued Mar 2023\n\nCoursera logo\nPractical Time Series Analysis, by SUNYPractical Time Series Analysis, by SUNY\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued Jul 2022Issued Jul 2022\nCredential ID JF3E2ZYX7W4V\n\nKNIME logo\nL1: Basic Proficiency in KNIME Analytics PlatformL1: Basic Proficiency in KNIME Analytics Platform\nKNIMEKNIME\nIssued Aug 2022 · Expires Aug 2024\n\nCoursera logo\nVersion Control with Git by AtlassianVersion Control with Git by Atlassian\nCourseraCoursera\nIssued Jan 2023\n\nAtlassian logo\nJira Fundamentals BadgeJira Fundamentals Badge\nAtlassianAtlassian\nIssued Nov 2022Issued Nov 2022\nCredential ID Completion ID: 232267539\n\nNot all, and perhaps even none, of the online courses needs to be explicitly mentioned; perhaps some should be; they are to give a flavor of the training I've done\n\nDigest this, and my resume and instructions will follow""]"

It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:\n - `contents: read & write`\n - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example setting all of the input parameters.\n\n\n\nHere is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event.\nNote that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.\n\n\n\n### Dispatch to multiple repositories\n\nYou can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy]( In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.\n\n\n\n## Client payload\n\nThe GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON.\nIf you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.\n\n\n\nFor example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.\n\n\n\nTo solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property.\nThe following payload will succeed.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`.
