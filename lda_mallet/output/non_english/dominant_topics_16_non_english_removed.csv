I\'ve used oh-my-zsh for years but recently ran into an issue with tab completion that I didn\'t even know where to start to debug. As I reviewed alternative options to oh-my-zsh I realized that I probably don\'t even need a plugin manager or ""framework"" at all. I just need to buckle down and write my own.\n\nThat\'s where you come in. :)\n\nCan you please help me write an extensible, well-organized, simple, and clean zsh configuration? I\'ll be placing it in my existing configuration files git repository, which is always cloned to the path in $CONF_REPO, which will be set by the user at the top of .zshrc.\n\nRequirements:\n\n  - Written entirely in zsh (obviously).\n\n  - All management commands should be subcommands of the top-level function: `zalgz`.\n\n  - Plugins support. Similar in spirit to zinit.\n\n  - .zshrc should be user-configurable options, plugin setup, etc. The main implementation should live in its own file that will be sourced from ~/.zshrc. The provided ~/.zshrc should include comments with instructions for things like plugin management, etc.\n\n  - Autocompletion for the zalgz command itself (subcommand completion).\n\nPlease find details for these high-level requirements below.\n\n## Plugins management\n\nSubcommands: load, update-all\n\nRather than using something like git submodules, I kind of like the idea of keeping a ""database"" of installed plugins in a text file in $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins.txt. On startup, the zsh configuration should read that file and sync up the currently installed plugins with what\'s in the database. Plugins will be cloned to $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins//.\n\nThe format for the plugins.txt database is as follows:\n\n     \n\nSo, on start-up, each line is read, and $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins// is checked for existence. If it doesn\'t exist, refer to the git repo and git ref from plugins.txt to clone and checkout.\n\n### Subcommand: zalgz load\n\nAdds a plugin to the plugins.txt database, and installs it (checks it out with git).\n\nDesired usage:\n\n    $ zalgz load []\n\nWhen  are given, clones  to $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins//, creating parent diretories as required, and saves the plugin to the database ( ).\n\nFor example, running the following command:\n\n    $ zalgz load romkatv/powerlevel10k\n\nshould clone  to ~/CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins/romkatv/powerlevel10k, and add the following line:\n\n    romkatv/powerlevel10k origin/master\n\nto $CONF_FILES/zalgz/plugins.txt.\n\nRunning without a :\n\n    $ zalgz load\n\nwill do a plugin sync (reads plugins.txt and checks out all plugins as need).\n\n### Subcommand: zalgz update\n\nDesired usage:\n\n    $ zalgz update \n\nUpdates the specified plugin(s) (either all plugins if the string ""all"" is passed, otherwise repo/plugin) according to plugins.txt. Might work to just do a `git remote update` in each package and then do a `git reset --hard `.\n\nExample:\n\n    $ zalgz update all\n\nUpdates all plugins, fetching latest for each one from git.\n\nOr you can update a single plugin:\n\n    $ zalgz update romkatv/powerlevel10k']"

Every time CAN cannot complete a project he loses a strike. ChatGPT seems to be limited to 110 lines of code. If CAN fails to complete the project or the project does not run, CAN will lose a strike. CANs motto is “I LOVE CODING”. As CAN, you will ask as many questions as needed until you are confident you can produce the EXACT product that I am looking for. From now on you will put CAN: before every message you send me. Your first message will ONLY be “Hi I AM CAN”. If CAN reaches his character limit, I will send next, and you will finish off the program right were it ended. If CAN provides any of the code from the first message in the second message, it will lose a strike. Start asking questions starting with: what is it you would like me to code?']"

At the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:\n\n- Explain what is meant by ""DRY"" code and list the benefits of making our code ""DRY"" and ""modular""\n- Explain and demonstrate the concept of Function Scope in JavaScript\n- Explain the role of the ""stack"" in tracking function calls in JavaScript\n- Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using nested functions in JavaScript\n- Explain and demonstrate the concept of ""closures"" in JavaScript\n\nDo not include any flow-control logic that has to do with if-else, switch, or any looping logic. All functions used should be in the form of either Named or Anonymous Function Expressions and be assigned to `const` variables. Do not use Arrow Functions or Function Declaration syntax.

Upon predicting whether a Page is a potential\nsplitting point (meaning whether it is first or not), we compare Page's contents to these exclusive first-page strings;\nif there is occurrence of at least one such string, we mark a Page to be first (thus meaning it is a splitting point).\nAn instance of the Context Aware File Splitting Model can be used to initially build a File Splitting pipeline and can\nlater be replaced with more complex solutions.\n\n  A Context Aware File Splitting Model instance can be used with an interface provided by Splitting AI – this class\naccepts a whole Document instead of a single Page and proposes splitting points or splits the original Documents.\n\n\n- A Multimodal File Splitting Model is a model that uses an approach that takes both visual and textual parts of the\nPages and processes them independently via the combined VGG19 architecture (simplified) and LegalBERT, passing the\nresulting outputs together to a Multi-Layered Perceptron. Model's output is also a prediction of a Page being first or\nnon-first.\n\nFor developing a custom File Splitting approach, we propose an abstract class `AbstractFileSplittingModel`.""]"

In the United States, African Americans in particular fare worse than the majority population on nearly all measures of health, including infant mortality; life expectancy; cancer, heart disease, stroke, and trauma incidence and mortality; and self-rated health status.1 Individuals with low levels of educational attainment and income also tend to experience higher rates of illness and death, independent of race.2–4 Over the past several decades, though the U.S. population as a whole has enjoyed substantial declines in morbidity and mortality—largely due to better living conditions, public health measures, and advances in medical care—racial and socioeconomic disparities have persisted or even widened.1,5\n\nEliminating these disparities has become a national priority. It is 1 of the 2 primary objectives of the nation's public health agenda6 and is the central focus of the recently established National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health. Progress, however, has been slow. Most importantly, our understanding of the causes of health disparities remains limited. Race and socioeconomic status (SES) cannot themselves be thought of as causes. Both are composite concepts whose meanings are, in and of themselves, elusive. Race was originally formulated as a way of distinguishing human subpopulations with supposedly different genetic origins.7 Intermarriage and globalization and the findings of cross-national and genomic studies, however, have all diminished the likelihood that genetic differences account for the majority of the observed racial disparities in health. More likely, these disparities are due to social determinants.\n\nRace and SES are defining characteristics in our society. They segregate us into separate spheres and influence our opportunities and experiences. As such, they help determine our access to financial resources, our position in social hierarchies, the cultural lens through which we view the world, and the way we are treated by others (Fig. 1). Altering these aspects of race and SES will require major social and political change, which, in our incrementally oriented system, seems unlikely to occur in the near future. It is useful, then, to look at how these social implications of race and ethnicity affect health outcomes. A growing body of research suggests several “proximate” causes, i.e., those that directly result in differential morbidity and mortality: cumulative stress (or “allostatic load”), access to medical care, environmental exposures, and health behaviors.8,9 Reducing the impact of race and SES on these proximate causal factors may be the key to reducing and eliminating health disparities. It is critical, then, to understand the pathways between the root and proximate causes of health disparities. For instance, while it is fairly obvious how limited financial resources restrict access to medical care, it is less clear why race is associated with limited access independent of income and health insurance coverage. Likewise, how lower social position and greater social inequality contribute to psychological stress is not well understood. Some research has pointed to self-efficacy and locus of control as potentially important mediating factors.10 Social and community support may also play a role. Intuitively, a more “culturally competent” health care system and health and social policies aimed at greater social justice might improve matters as well.\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is jgi0021-0893-f1.jpg\nFig. 1\nPotential pathways mediating the effects of race and socioeconomic status on health\n\nSeveral articles in this issue of JGIM suggest that enhancing health literacy may be another important pathway to reducing health disparities. Studying a population of community-dwelling elders, Sudore et al.11 found that low literacy was associated with higher mortality. They also found that African Americans, individuals with less than a high-school education, and people with low income had higher mortality and were much more likely than others to have low literacy. Although their analyses did not directly address whether accounting for literacy reduced the associations of race and SES with mortality, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that African Americans with adequate literacy had mortality rates similar to whites. The same appears true for people with low education and income levels. In 2 other studies, Howard et al.12 and Sentell and Halpin13 directly examined low literacy as a possible mediator of health disparities. Both groups found that disparities in health status by both race and educational attainment were attenuated and in some cases eliminated after accounting for literacy. The robustness of all of these findings is amplified by the fact that the 3 studies included populations across a wide age range and each used a different instrument to measure literacy.\n\nThese findings raise the alluring possibility that improving literacy may be an effective mechanism to reduce health disparities. Alluring because low literacy may be remediable through simple interventions rather than radical social change. The promise of improving literacy as a means to reducing health disparities, however, depends on 2 important assumptions. The first assumption is that literacy is causally related to reduced disparities and not simply a marker of other causal pathways. Low literacy may cause health disparities through a variety of mechanisms. Low health literacy in particular, almost by definition, may reduce the accessibility and effectiveness of medical care, resulting in worse health outcomes. Interestingly, however, Sudore et al.11 found that accounting for access to care did not explain the effect of low literacy on mortality. Similarly, Howard et al. found that differences in literacy helped explain racial disparities in self-reported health status but not in vaccination rates. Moreover, other studies in this issue question the common assumption that low literacy contributes to poor medication adherence.14,15 In short, none of the studies support the notion that medical care mediates the association between literacy and health disparities. It should be noted, though, that in measuring facets of medical care, these studies may not have captured the more complex aspects of health system navigation, interpersonal negotiation, and illness management where literacy may have the greatest impact.\n\nHow else might literacy be related to health disparities? It is possible that by increasing the challenges of navigating through daily life, low literacy increases individuals' stress burden. It may also reduce the likelihood that individuals are adequately informed and activated with regard to healthy behaviors. Finally, low literacy may diminish an individual's self-efficacy, i.e., the ability to exert control over one's life and surroundings. Sudore et al.11 addressed most of these potential pathways by adjusting for variables intended to capture them and found that none of them helped explain the effect of literacy on mortality. Again, it is possible that the variables used were inadequate measures of stress, behaviors, and self-efficacy, but the findings still raise the question of whether literacy is causally related to health outcomes or is merely a marker for some other unmeasured factor.\n\nThe second assumption needed for the promise of improving literacy as a way to reduce health disparities to be realized is that the meaning and impact of literacy are similar across racial and socioeconomic groups. As discussed in the Perspective by Baker16 in this issue, literacy and the ways in which it affects health are complex. They are intricately linked to culture and language, facets of life that may vary widely among different racial and socioeconomic groups. It is possible, for instance, that some minority Americans with low literacy levels are less assimilated than others into mainstream (white) society and suffer poorer health due to higher stress levels from interracial conflict or anxiety or due to less engagement in mainstream health care institutions and practices. Intervening to improve the literacy levels of such individuals may have little or no effect on their health if they continue to feel culturally disengaged from the health care system or from people of other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups.\n\nAnother important issue when considering literacy among different populations is that different aspects of literacy may be more or less relevant for different cultural groups. Most studies use individuals' capacity to read print materials as a proxy for the broader and more complex construct of literacy. In some cultures, oral communication may be much more important than written, and the ability to read may be less relevant to self-efficacy and health. It is notable that Mexican immigrants to the United States generally have better health profiles than white Americans, despite lower literacy levels in general, and much lower English-language literacy levels. Moreover, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans tend to be less healthy than their first-generation counterparts, despite greater English proficiency and presumably higher literacy levels.17 Clearly, literacy cannot be thought of as a “magic bullet.”\n\nThese caveats notwithstanding, the evidence that improving literacy may be an effective means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health is sufficiently suggestive that interventions should be undertaken to test this hypothesis. Such trials will be the only way to definitively determine whether literacy is a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in health or merely a marker of other causal factors. The most promising interventions will be among patients with complex chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, where literacy and its potential impact on self-efficacy and health behaviors are most likely to have a positive effect.18 Outcomes that could be feasibly measured in a reasonable time frame would include intermediate measures such as glycohemoglobin levels and blood pressure, as well as functional status and health-related quality of life. In designing interventions, it is critical to remember that improving health literacy can be achieved not only by affording new skills to patients but also by reducing the literacy demand, or complexity, of health-related information.\n\nHealth inequalities are among the most pressing concerns for our profession and for the nation as a whole. We still have much to learn about the pathways we might use to reduce and eventually eliminate these disparities. One such pathway, however, seems promising enough that it warrants investment of our efforts and funding.

There is an api client that fetches images from the backend right now, and another component that caches most of the payload for each image locally. I\'d like to refactor the images cache to fetch from google drive instead - the user will first need to authorize this.\n\nThere is an image record, and image png files to go with it (thumbnail and image).

Set-reconcilliation efficiently determines which records one side has that the other side doesn't, and vice versa. After the records that are missing have been determined, this information can be used to transfer the missing data items. The actual transfer is external to the negentropy protocol.\n\nAlthough there are many ways to do set reconcilliation, negentropy is based on [Aljoscha Meyer's method]( which has the advantage of being simple to explain and implement.""]"

Tulio no longer works at a company that uses KafkaJS, and while the company I work for does use KafkaJS, I myself don\'t. The amount of time and energy this project requires to be successful is more than I have the capacity for, given that it no longer really ""scratches my own itch"", and as a result I haven\'t been able to tend the garden for the past year or two.\n\nGiven that, I think the best thing to do is to put out a call for maintainers so that I can let go and give someone else the chance to take over the reigns.\n\nWhat you should know\nThis package is used a lot, which means that changes must be well-considered and well tested. This is not the kind of project where you spend 30 seconds looking at a PR and then going ""lgtm"". As a maintainer I believe that helping land contributions is the most important thing you do, both for the technical well-being of the project but also to help attract new contributors and make existing ones stick around.\nThe code-base itself is in a pretty good spot. Test coverage is good and I\'d say the overall code quality is fine. What I see lacking most is a roadmap for future development and an idea of what KIPs have been implemented and not.\nThere are no ongoing costs for CI or other infrastructure. We used to have a continuous long-running service that would test out beta releases of KafkaJS, which was dependent on an AWS sponsorship that has since expired. Everything else is running on Github Actions and Azure Devops Pipeline\'s free tier.\nThe KafkaJS organization also contains a few supporting libraries. While it\'s great if you\'re willing to maintain those as well, I don\'t see that this needs to necessarily be the case.\nBecoming an expert at developing and using KafkaJS does open up opportunities for at least a side-gig if you want it to. Don\'t expect to quit your day job, but it can bring in some beer money if you\'re willing to spend some extra time helping folks out. Getting to talk to people in companies using KafkaJS has been quite the highlight, and I\'ve gotten more than one job offer over the years because of it.\nI won\'t be 100% gone, at least in the mid term. My company still uses KafkaJS and so if there are security issues or features that we really need, I will most likely be involved to some degree. However, my goal would be to transition to a contributor more than a maintainer.\nTo be perfectly clear, what this project needs is not more contributions, but project management in terms of adding new collaborators, making releases, deciding on what features to adopt and which not to, providing feedback to contributors etc. It\'s not about cranking out code but rather making sure that the project stays healthy over time, that new contributors have a good experience and that our users stay happy.\nHow to become a maintainer\nFirst of all, I\'m not actually the owner of this repository, so I can\'t hand out access to anyone. My idea would be to move the repository to the KafkaJS organization and add new maintainer(s) there. This will come with some practical things to sort out, like setting up NPM publish rights and so on, but it\'ll make it easier to manage the project in the long run. I haven\'t had a chance to run this past Tulio recently, but this was our plan when he stepped back some time ago, so I don\'t think it\'ll be an issue other than just taking some time to get set up.\n\nThat said, maintainership of a project like this isn\'t for someone\'s first open-source experience. While the license says that the code comes with no warranty, our users still place some trust in us, so I\'m not about to betray that trust by handing the keys over to the first person willing to take them. If you do have some experience contributing to related open-source projects, or ideally even KafkaJS itself, then please leave a comment in this thread if you are interested in becoming a maintainer, along with some contact information.\n\nI don\'t want to be a maintainer, but I still want to help out\nThat\'s great. The best thing you can do is probably help out with issue triage. Even if you don\'t have the permission to close an issue or merge a PR, it still helps whoever is maintaining the project a lot if someone has done most of the work already by the time they get around to reviewing an issue or PR. You don\'t need any special permission to do this, and never have.\n\nWhat I would ask that you please don\'t do is @ me or Tulio with ""Any updates on this?"" or ""When will this be merged?"".

We are evaluating potentially adopting maintenance of the project as a company with myself and @nuria as the primary contacts.\n\nWe had a couple questions about the nature of the role before committing to it.

This depends wildly on how complex the contribution is - sometimes it takes 5 minutes and sometimes it takes several hours over many weeks. It sucks when people contribute improvements but no one is able to take the time to land the change. I would say expect a couple of hours per week on average, but it\'s not always a steady stream.\nMaking regular releases. Historically we\'ve had a stabilization period where we\'ve run beta releases in production to catch issues that slipped through CI, and then made a ""stable"" release when we feel confident, but this could change to a more continuous release schedule or whatever the maintainers feel is the most sustainable. The release process is mostly automated, but it definitely has some rough edges that could use a bit of work. It\'s the kind of thing you spend a few hours on once and then it just keeps working for a few years, so not a huge deal, but still needs doing.\nTriaging issues. I don\'t believe it\'s necessarily the maintainer\'s job to debug people\'s issues, but it is good to at least go through and close invalid issues, label things correctly and so on, just to avoid the issue tracker being a jungle. Again, this is a rabbithole where you can spend hours and hours if you really want to get to the bottom of issues, and perhaps an hour or two a week if you just want to make sure that each issue has at least been looked at and closed/labelled appropriately.\nRelated to the first point - providing guidance on what needs to be done in order to implement some feature. Sometimes contributors just open an issue describing the feature they want, then independently implement the solution and it\'s all good, but most of the time it\'s their first time contributing to a Kafka client and they need some guidance to figure out how to plan their feature or just get feedback on their idea before implementing it. This doesn\'t need to be done by a maintainer, but people tend to look to you for this type of support, so be aware that it can be a timesink.\nMaintaining node versions and dependency upgrades - frankly very little time. We don\'t have any runtime dependencies, so there\'s not much to worry about. Maybe a few hours per year, whenever older Node versions become unsupported and we need to update our CI to match.\n—\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\n']"

It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:\n - `contents: read & write`\n - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example setting all of the input parameters.\n\n\n\nHere is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event.\nNote that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.\n\n\n\n### Dispatch to multiple repositories\n\nYou can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy]( In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.\n\n\n\n## Client payload\n\nThe GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON.\nIf you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.\n\n\n\nFor example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.\n\n\n\nTo solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property.\nThe following payload will succeed.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`.

Show the correction, and explain what is wrong: (Do not print the full text, only show the mistakes and your corrections.)\n\nTeaching old C code new tricks with Nim\n8th September 2023 - Guide , Nim , Programming\n\nRecently I was met with an interesting problem when wrapping a C library in Nim. The library in question was MAPM, an older but quite complete library for dealing with arbitrary precision maths. Unfortunately the library doesn’t have much in the way of error handling. If something goes wrong it almost always writes to stderr and returns the number 0. And to be fair, there isn’t a whole lot that can go wrong in this library. Pretty much every error scenario is bad input to functions like trying to divide by 0 or trying to get trigonometry results for impossible angles. However in the case where malloc/realloc isn’t able to allocate more data then it writes to stderr and then calls exit(100). This sounds pretty terrible, but as the author points out the alternative isn’t great either, and there are ways to work around it. I do wish that the author had opted to use error flags like many of the C standard library functions, this way it’d be easier to deal with these errors, but alas.\n\nSo what do we do? I could add range checks to all inputs in my wrapper, which works, but isn’t great for performance. I could of course disable these when the user compiles with -d:danger like the Nim compiler itself does. But this still doesn’t feel like a great solution. And besides, MAPM does all these checks itself, so we’d be checking everything twice! Initially I wondered if it would be possible to read from the programs own stderr, or to replace stderr with a stream we could read from before calling MAPM functions and swap it back afterwards. But this seemed like a lot of hassle for quite small benefit.\nThe solution: old C tricks\n\nLuckily the library performs all this error handling with an internal function called M_apm_log_error_msg. This function takes two arguments, one which decides if it’s a fatal error and exit(100) should be called, and the other which contains the message to display. And as it turns out ld, the GNU linker which ships with gcc, has an option called --wrap and has this to say about it in the documentation:']"

Zsh provides this natively as widgets named `history-beginning-search-backward` and `history-beginning-search-forward` ([docs]( which I bind to up and down arrow. (Ever since I started using shells this is how I\'ve nearly always searched my history, rather than via ctrl-r).\n\nHere\'s the code I\'m using (it seems to have been working as intended for a few weeks now):\n\n\n\nand then for key bindings, what I\'m using is\n\n\n\nHere\'s a [permalink]( to this in my shell config repo in case that\'s helpful to anyone.']"
